# Notes on Assignment 2 Solution

* Mostly the same HTML as Assignment 1
* wrapped a `div.sections` around the three sections
* made that `div` the flex-parent
* created a `.captioned` class for the weird figure captions
* put that class on the `figure` elements
* made the `img` in the captioned figures 80% with 2em top/bottom margins
* made the `figcaption` be `position:absolute`
* set its `top` and `left`
* added the media query to switch the direction for wide screens
* (not required) made them all the same width and put 5px between them.
