Files in this directory are local caches of files that otherwise come from
elsewhere on the web.  Having a local copy means that pages can load
quicker, but we should make some regular effort to make sure they are
up-to-date.

This can be done by regularly (say, weekly) executing the update-cache.sh
script in this directory.
