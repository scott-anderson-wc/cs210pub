# About CS 204

This course is about Front-End Web Development.  The "front-end" is jargon
for all the stuff that goes on in the browser. (The "back-end" is the term
for all the operations on the server, which usually means updating
databases to record information that the user has submitted or retrieving
information that was previously stored.)  The front end includes:

* structuring the content using HTML
* styling the content using CSS
* dynamically updating the page using JavaScript (JS) and jQuery (JQ)

## Intended Audience

This course is intended for beginning CS and MAS majors. Its prerequisites
are CS 111, CS 115 or an equivalent "CS 1" course that introduces
programming (variables, conditionals, functions, objects and so
on). Knowledge of JavaScript is not required.

## History

This course grew out of the realization that although the Computer Science
department no longer had the resources to teach the popular CS 110 course
for non-majors and it reluctantly had to stop offering that course, much
of the content of that course was valuable to CS and MAS
majors. Therefore, this course was created to cover similar ground, but
starting with an assumption that students know the basics of
programming. It's also intended to go a bit farther and faster than CS 110
did. Nevertheless, because of the substantial overlap between CS 110 and
CS 204, a student cannot earn credit for both courses.

## Tentative topics

is still being created, so these will certainly change.
