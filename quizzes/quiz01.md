<ol class="questions">

<li> The reading says that &lt;div&gt; is overused, but do the &lt;section&gt; tags etc
have styling that is inherently connected to it? aka is &lt;div&gt; the
simplest//most customizable container to divide content?

<p>They do have default styling, but the point is more about semantic
tagging: marking the relative importance or role that content plays.

<li>Is the &lt;head&gt; not a visible component of the page? Just a directory of sorts to let the server know what it should look for? and then &lt;header&gt; would be the physical division at the top of a page w title etc?"

<p>The head is meta information, not content

<li>Can we talk more about the terminal commands?

<p>Sure. What do you want to know?

<li>I do not currently have any questions, that I can think of. If I do
think of something, I will bring them up in class :)

<p>Thanks!

<li>What's the best way to place a line of text as a caption right below
an image? Would this have to be styled through CSS?

<p>Yes, using CSS. We'll learn how to do this in chapter 3

<li>When I attempted to validate the Ottergram HTML, it did not work
because the link rerouted to a Cloud9 sign-in page. The validator analyzed
the sign-in page, not the page I had created with the otter pictures.  I'm
not sure if this is because I am working in a private workspace, or if
this happens to all Cloud9 documents?

<p>Hmm. Cloud9 doesn't seem to send a "referer" header, so this feature is
broken. I'll look in to it.

<li>Also, I could not get the favicon.ico to show up on the tab.  I
generated a favicon.ico file, and put it in the same directory as
index.html, but it is not showing when I run and click on the link.

<p>Talk to me after class

<li>I noticed the HTML template for Cloud9 does not include the line &lt;meta
charset=""utf-8""&gt;.  Is this because we are using the same browser for
Cloud9 and the generated page?

<p>No, I think it's an oversite on their part. I think it makes sense to
add it.

<li>I noticed the reading says that &lt;img&gt; tags are closed tags, but I
noticed on Cloud9 when I typed img and hit tab, it automatically generated
a close tab &lt;/img&gt;. Is the &lt;/img&gt; necessary?"

<p>No; that's weird, and it's not valid HTML. We'll have to use our
knowledge instead.

<li>for question two on this quiz, is answer b supposed to be DIV divides
*the page* into smaller pieces?

     <p>No, B is as stated. It's not the correct answer, which is that
     it's for big sections of the document.
