<ol class="questions">


<li>Just a general overview of Flexbox would be nice! :)

<li>Could we talk more about flexbox and its uses?

<li>Could you explain the difference between flex boxes and regular
containers, and also the meaning of the flex shorthand property (flex: 0 1
auto)?

<p>That property says "don't grow me, shrink me if needed, automatically
calculate my size)

<li>How to place items in a coordinate system

<p>We'll definitely go over that. 

<li>How can our formatting help or not help accessibility for different people?

<p>Great question! The last day of class is devoted to accessibility, but
we should be thinking about it throughout. Generally speaking, pages are
presented by accessibility aids in source order, so rearranging things
using CSS can be bad if it hides important stuff.  For example, putting
the navigation last in the HTML and then using CSS to put it at the top of
the page:  a blind visitor might have to read the whole page before
getting to the navigation.  So far, I haven't seen anything they've done
that impairs accessibility, but let's keep an eye on it.
