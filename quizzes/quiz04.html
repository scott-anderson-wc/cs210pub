<ol class="questions">

<li>Are we supposed to be started on the assignment due next Wednesday
already? 
<div class="ans">
<p>I've assigned partners and you should start soon.
</div>

<li>How do we access these "local accounts" on our phones if we don't
have these files / are logged into vscode on our phones?
<div class="ans">
<p>I don't understand this question.
Do you mean your account on cs.wellesley.edu? The URL is `https://cs.wellesley.edu/~youracct/`
</div>

<li>how to apply media queries in an example
<div class="ans">
<p>We'll use Ottergram; hopefully that will be okay. But we can visit <a href="http://hubspot.com/products/get-started">hubspot</a>
</div>

<li>What is meant by the "order" of a thumbnail-list and setting it to values like 0 or 2?
/ What does changing the .thumbnail-list order do?

<div class="ans">
<p>It means whether the element is displayed first, last, or whereever. So you can use CSS to re-order things on the page, without changing the HTML!

</div>

<li>I'd like to talk more about viewports, I feel like I've got a very
loose and basic grasp on them right now.  / Why bother with layout vs
visual viewpoint? Why not just always code with the visual in mind?

<div class="ans">

<p>Imagine that you are looking at an 8.5x11 sheet of paper through a 3x5
index card. The layout viewport is the the paper. The visual viewport is
the index card.

<P>In this chapter, we make them the same.

<p>I agree that having visual different from layout seems odd. It may be a
part of the history of the web: big desktop screens came first, and when
phones came along, they just used a small visual viewport onto the larger
layout viewport.

</div>

<li>The reading mentions the largest screen to be a laptop, but how would we apply @media on even larger screens like Flat screen tv's or let's say a VR 'screen'

<div class="ans">
<p>great point!  You can certainly have rules for very large devices:
<pre>
@media all and (min-width: 8000px) {
    /* rules for huge device */
}
</pre>

</div>


<li>So is the rule to design a website for a phone from the beginning and then move to a larger device? I'm still a little confused on this: can you design the same website to appear differently on different screens but using the same documents. is that the media query's job or is it an addition to that?

<div class="ans">
<p>Exactly right. Same HTML, same CSS file, but different sets of rules are activated for bigger devices.
</div>

<li>How would I turn a normal website into one fit for a mobile app? Does the HTML stay the same and just the CSS change? Would tags used in the HTML change?

<div class="ans">
<p>Yes. Same HTML, same CSS file. And same tags in the HTML.
</div>

<li>How media queries work

<div class="ans">

<p>The different rules replace/override the earlier ones.  So, I might use
a bigger font on a larger device, and layout certain elements side-by-side
instead of vertically.  </div>

<li>Should every program we make have different styles for desktops and
mobile devices using media queries.

<div class="ans">

<p>You don't have to take advantage of the extra space, but you can. Later
in the course, we're going to worry more about JS than layout.  </div>


<li>I would like to talk more about using device mode.

<div class="ans">
<p>Do you mean in the Chrome Inspector? We'll do that today!
</div>

<li>How media queries and flexbox work together. The Ottergram example in the book had us recode the flex-box- is that because they wanted it to be a teaching moment? In other words, could we have just coded it for mobile optimization in the first place? Or do you have to tweak your flex-box whenever you're coding to figure out what works right? 

<div class="ans">

<p>I'm confused. In Chapter 5, we didn't change the HTML at all (well,
other than changing the visual viewport). Our flexbox was unchanged. We
did change the <em>layout</em> of the flexbox, from column to row and
such.

</div>

<li>what exactly does overflow:hidden do?

<div class="ans">
<p>Chops off any content that doesn't fit in the container, as opposed to
creating a scroll bar.
</div>

<li>I'd like to go more in depth with Media Queries.

<div class="ans">
<p>I'd be glad to talk to you more outside class. For now, we're just
going to inquire about the width of the device. (I've also used it in the
past for print styles.) And, see below.
</div>

<li>I just want to try it out
/ I would just like to see this code play out in action through the activities! 
/ More practice on changing the sizes around would be helpful!
/ Everything seems clear to me. 

<div class="ans">
<p>Great! Let's get started!
</div>
