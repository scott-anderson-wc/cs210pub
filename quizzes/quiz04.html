<ol class="questions">

<li>I'd appreciate if you further explained media queries. I'm confused about
what the difference between the two is. Aren't they both accomplishing the
same thing?

<p>What two things?

<li>I'm somewhat confused about what the "all and" part of the @media line stand for.

<p>You can customize the <em>kind</em> of device (e.g. <code>print</code>
versus <code>screen</code>). That goes where the <code>all</code> is.
See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries">MDN
media queries</a>

<li>In a media query, how do you specify mobile layouts depending on
horizontal/vertical orientation?

    <p>Use <code>(orientation: landscape)</code> or <code>(orientation: portrait)</code>. Again,
See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries">MDN
media queries</a>

<li>How should you know what pixel size to specify in a media query?

    <p>There are standard sizes/breakpoints for different common
    devices. Chrome developer tools can help here. Your book lists some.

<li>What is the difference between layout viewport and visual viewport other than size?

    <p>The former is used, as you might guess, for <em>layout</em>. The
    latter is a window on the former, so you might need to scroll,
    magnify, etc.

<li> Why is the visual viewport narrower than the layout viewport?

<p>Because we either want to see everything or part of everything, but we never want to see more than everything.

<li>what is a breakpoint?

    <p>A device size that triggers a change in the CSS rules (and, often, a change in layout).

<li>I noticed that webpages use media queries for mobile devices, but some webpages use a separate page for mobile devices. How can the webpage detect that the user is viewing the page from mobile device? Also, why do some webpages use a separate mobile page instead of using media queries?

<div class="ans">
<p>The browser sends an identifying string saying "I'm Chrome" or "I'm
Firefox" and your browser can detect that. Best practice is <em>not</em>
to do that, though, because (1) it's better to think
of <em>capabilities</em>, (2) you might not catch every case, and (3)
browsers can lie.

<p>Separate pages can allow the CSS to be streamlined, omitting anything
that is irrelevant, instead of overriding it, but in many cases the
separate page is a legacy from the days before media queries.
</div>

<li>What counts and does not count as "responsive"?  When we use ems and
set widths as percentages, so that they adjust as the window expands, is
that also responsive, or is there a different term?

    <p>Ems and percentages is part of being responsive. Being responsive
    doesn't have a mathematical definition, but is the goal of adjusting
    (responding) to different size devices.

<li>Difference between media query css and normal css when it comes to
rendering hierarchy. Is it guaranteed that putting a certain size limit on
the alternate css will make it disable at the right size? Also, which
version of the css gets priority, the regular version or the one that
specifies a certain window size?

    <p>There's no difference. Later rules override earlier rules, so
    standard practice is to specify the default first, and then override
    for larger devices. Thus, media queries don't complicate the rules for
    how CSS cascades. As for the guarantee, a browser could be broken,
    non-compliant or just old, but there's nothing we can do about that.

<li>Run through an example in which we convert code for a desktop webpage
to mobile (viewports practice)

<div class="ans">
    <p>Actually, we want to do the opposite: convert a mobile page into a
    desktop page.  We'll do it with this page:

<pre id="style1dst"></pre>
<script>
    document.getElementById('style1dst').innerHTML = document.getElementById('style1').textContent;
</script>

</div>

<li>I'm okay for now! I just need more practice. / Just need more practice 

<p>Great!
