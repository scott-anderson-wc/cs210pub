# CS210: Introduction to Front-End Web Development

<div id="splash"></div>

## Bulletin Description

This course introduces modern web development using HTML, CSS and
JavaScript. JavaScript is explored in detail, including scoping, closures,
objects, prototype inheritance, and namespacing. The jQuery library is
also introduced, and the course covers event handling and Ajax
interactions. Students will build web pages using front-end templates such
as bootstrap and JavaScript libraries for client-side templating. Designed
web pages will be modern, responsive and accessible. The course also
covers the jQuery UI (User Interface) library and its capabilities. Other
topics may include encryption, copyright, intellectual property and
version control.

## Intended Audience

This course is intended for beginning CS and MAS majors. Its prerequisites
are CS 111, CS 115 or an equivalent "CS 1" course that introduces
programming (variables, conditionals, functions, objects and so
on). Knowledge of JavaScript is not required.

## History

This course grew out of the realization that although the Computer Science
department no longer had the resources to teach the popular CS 110 course
for non-majors and it reluctantly had to stop offering that course, much
of the content of that course was valuable to CS and MAS
majors. Therefore, this course was created to cover similar ground, but
starting with an assumption that students know the basics of
programming. It's also intended to go a bit farther and faster than CS 110
did. Nevertheless, because of the substantial overlap between CS 110 and
CS 210, a student cannot earn credit for both courses.
