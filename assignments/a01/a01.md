# First Web Page

## Purpose

In this assignment, you'll show your command of these concepts and skills

* basic HTML
* basic CSS
* hyperlinks
* validation

The idea of the assignment is to build a page describing yourself (or a
fictional character). I used Hermione Granger.

There will be three sections with similar content types (a figure, with a
caption, some paragraphs, and some lists), but different background
colors, pictures and text.

## Pair Programming

Pair Programming is encouraged for this assignment, but not
required. Choose one person to be the host and the other the guest and use
her workspace (though you should share the coding/typing duties).

If physical proximity is not possible when you work together, the host can
share her private workspace, read-write (RW) with the guest, so that
either person can edit the files.

When the assignment is done, the host should revoke this sharing, so that
she can share her workspace with other people in later assignments. We
don't want to end up with every private workspace shared with everyone in
the class!

## To Do

You must do the following

* make a directory for this assignment in your C9 workspace:
`mkdir a01-work`
* Set up the basic page HTML. I suggest you use the
  [template](../../reading/template.html) in the reading, despite the fact that the validation
  links don't work. Maybe we'll get them to work.
* make a subdirectory for your images: `mkdir a01/images`
* write your HTML:
    * three sections
    * each with a figure with a caption
    * some paragraphs
    * a list
* style your content    
* validate the result

## Styling

* use margins and padding to keep text from jamming up against the borders
* figures have a two-pixel border in silver
* figure captions also have a border (1 pixel black)
* figure caption elements are 80% of their container, centered
* figure text is centered within its container
* figure captions have a background color that is 50% transparent of 80% gray.
* each section should have a different background color
* the list with the validation icons has no bullets and is horizontal
* the main figures scale with the browser; the icons don't
* refer to the screencast:

<video controls style="width:50%;border:1px solid black">
    <source src="a01.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser doesn't support the video tag
</video>

## Final Checklist

* Make sure your name is in the files. If you have a partner, *both* names should be in the files.
* Make sure everything works and looks nice
* Make sure both the HTML and the CSS are valid
* Fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/a/wellesley.edu/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeaobYag3lesSo10kQqN2ViO1xJi4IqIkbrIVlIyglfbuhZ0g/viewform) That form will help me improve the course for next time. The form is anonymous; it will not collect your username.

## How to turn this in

In your C9 workspace, rename your working directory to a finished directory:

`mv a01-work a01-done`

then make it not writeable:

`chmod -R a-w a01-done`

Finally, touch the directory for the last time:

`touch a01-done`
