# Assignment: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This next assignment will actually not be very much coding, but we'll
build something fun (well, somewhat fun)

## Here it is in action:

<video controls style="width:50%;border:1px solid black">
    <source src="rps.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser doesn't support the video tag
</video>

## Directions

I'm going to leave all the markup, CSS and coding to you. You've already
built many of the parts, so you should re-use that code.

I will supply a set of images that you can use in this
[tarfile](../../downloads/rps-images.tar)

## Advice

* Build functions that you can test on their own, using the JS console,
rather than trying to build everything and test it using the click
handlers
* You can use either raw JS or jQuery to manipulate the DOM. I used
jQuery.
* Coding quality matters. Try to be concise and abstract.
* My code, including functions you've already written, and including blank
lines and comments space between functions, is still less than 100 lines.

## Final Checklist

* Make sure your name is in the files. If you have a partner, *both* names should be in the files.
* Make sure everything works and looks nice
* Make sure both the HTML and the CSS are valid
* Fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/a/wellesley.edu/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeIpFl9SBREEkdWU2_xQmpkeGUl3B31zmnrMpfl7Vj9zpy0XQ/viewform)
That form will help me improve the course for next time. The form is anonymous; it will not collect your username.

## How to turn this in

In your C9 workspace, rename your working directory to a finished directory:

`mv a04-work a04-done`

then make it not writeable:

`chmod -R a-w a04-done`

Finally, touch the directory for the last time:

`touch a04-done`
