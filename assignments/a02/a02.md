# Responsive Web Page

## Purpose

In this assignment, you'll show your command of these concepts and skills

* Flexbox
* Responsive web pages
* Media queries
* Absolute and Relative Positioning
* Validation

This assignment builds on the one you did last time, which will save
you a lot of HTML and CSS typing. My example is Hermione Granger.

You'll revise the CSS and add some media queries so that there's a
different layout for wider devices. 

## Pair Programming

Pair Programming strongly encouraged. Please see the spreadsheet I mailed
out.

Choose one person to be the host and the other the guest and use her
workspace (though you should share the coding/typing duties). Either
person's code for assignment 1 can be the starting point for this
assignment.

## To Do

You must do the following

* copy the directory for this assignment from the
previous solution:  `cp -r a01 a02`
* rename the main HTML file: `mv a02/a01.html a02/assign.html`
* Edit the CSS as specified below.
* validate the result

## Styling

* Use a flexbox layout to make the three sections vertical for narrow devices.
* The caption for the three big figures has moved. It's now in front of the picture, overlapping the top of it
* The the background color is now opaque white, so that the text shows up
* The top, left and right edges of the caption box are flush with the image.
* The image is 80% of the figure, centered
* There's 2em of distance between the top figure border and the top edge of the image
* There's a screenshot below for how I'd like it to look. 

<figure>
<img src="top-caption.png">
<figcaption>The caption is in front of the top of the picture</figcaption>
</figure>

Note that I had to do a fair amount of fiddling around in order to get
this to look right. One thing to remember is that the padding inside
something is the same distance as the margin outside of a child.

Secondly, you have to make it responsive. If there's lots of
horizontal space (> 768px) it should switch to a three-column layout,
like this:

<figure>
<img src="three-column-layout.png">
<figcaption>Three column layout on wide devices</figcaption>
</figure>

## Final Checklist

* Make sure your name is in the files. If you have a partner, *both* names should be in the files.
* Make sure everything works and looks nice
* Make sure both the HTML and the CSS are valid

## How to turn this in

We'll grade the work in your `a02` folder; no need to do anything else
