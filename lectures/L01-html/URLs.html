<h2 id="absolute">Absolute URLs</h2>

<P>URLs are meant to specify the locations of resources in files on
any computer in the world, so they can be a little complex.
Fortunately, most of a URL is straightforward and familiar to you.
Suppose we have a URL like:

<p>
<TABLE BORDER=1 style="cell-padding: 0px">
      <TR>
         <td><code>http://</code> </td>
         <td><code>cs.wellesley.edu/</code></td>
         <td><code>~cs110/lectures/L03-html/</code></td>
         <td><code>URLs.html</code></td>
      </TR>
      <TR>
      <TR>
         <td>protocol</td>
         <td>server.domain</td>
         <td>path</td>
         <td>filename</td>
      </TR>
  </TABLE>

<P>Let's break it down:

<UL>
   <LI><CODE>http://</CODE> This is the protocol, which is almost always
   HTTP, the Hyper Text Transport Protocol. You'll also occasionally
   see FTP, the File Transfer Protocol; HTTPS, the secure version of
   HTTP; and others.
   
   <LI><CODE>cs.wellesley.edu/</CODE> This is the <EM>server</EM>: a
   machine connected to the internet that hands out files to anyone
   who asks. <q><code>cs</code></q> is the name of the machine; 
   <q><code>wellesley.edu</code></q> is
   the domain. The name of the server combined with the domain must
   be <EM>unique</EM> in the <EM>world</EM>. In fact, the domain must
   be unique in the world, and the server name must be unique within
   the domain.
   
   <LI><CODE>~cs110/lectures/L03-html</CODE> This is the
   <EM>path</EM>: a sequence of directories (AKA folders), separated by
   slashes, that indicates where on the server the file is located. 
   In this path, there's a tilde (<code>~</code>), which means to start at the
   <CODE>public_html</CODE> directory under the <CODE>home</CODE>
   directory of the <CODE>cs110</CODE> account. We'll always be using
   that kind of URL in this class, so keep this special rule in mind.
   
   <LI><CODE>URLs.html</CODE> This is the file that is being
   requested.
</UL>

<P>Because URLs can specify files on many different kinds of
computers, you should stick to a lowest common denominator when
naming your directories and files, to avoid confusing machines and
browsers. The lowest common denominator means:

<UL>
   <LI>use letters and digits, but no special characters like /, *,
   #, &amp;, and so forth
   
   <LI>no spaces (this is the most common error for Mac and PC
   users). For example, if you want to have a web page named
   &ldquo;<CODE>cats and dogs.html</CODE>&rdquo; you're much safer
   with <CODE>cats-and-dogs.html</CODE> or
   <CODE>cats_and_dogs.html</CODE> </UL>

<P>Furthermore, be careful with upper and lower case. To your eyes,
<CODE>cats.html</CODE> and <CODE>Cats.html</CODE> may seem like the
same filename, but to a computer, they're as different as
<CODE>cats.html</CODE> and <CODE>dogs.html</CODE>. The same rule is true
of directory names: they are case-sensitive. Many people like to stick to
all lower-case, just so they don't have to remember.  Wellesley's web
standard is that folder names start with an upper-case letter and file
names start with a lower-case letter.

<div class="ex"><span class="ex">Exercise 1</span>

  <P>Use a file transfer program (such as Fetch or WinSCP) to create a
path of directories in your CS account, and then create a simple web
page that just says &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; and put it in the
bottommost directory. Finally, put in a link to that &ldquo;hello
world&rdquo; page in <code>little.html</code>.

</div>

<p>Certain parts of the end of an absolute URL can be omitted.  For
  example, the filename can be omitted and (usually) defaults to a file
  named <code>index.html</code> in the specified directory. Similarly, the
  path can be omitted, in which case the page is in the "top" directory of
  the web server.  However, <em>the protocol and server must be
  specified</em>. You can't omit those.  If a URL has a protocol, it's an
  absolute URL, otherwise it'll be treated as a relative URL.

<H2 id="trees">Tree Structured Directories</H2>

<P>As you know, most operating systems (including Unix, Macs, and Windows),
organize the contents of a computer's hard drive into 
<em>folders</em>, also called <em>directories</em>. Folders and files form
a <q>tree</q> structure, because of the ability of directories to contain
other directories.

<p>Here's an example:
  <blockquote>
    For a website about Joss Whedon, we might have a folder about his
    Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV show, another about the TV show Angel, and
    a document his comics.  These might all be in a top-level folder
    called <q>Joss</q>.  (The top-level folder is also called
    the <em>root</em> folder.) The folders about the TV shows might each have a
    sub-folder called <q>cast</q>.  And so on.
  </blockquote>

<p>While it's easy to conceptualize a tree of folders and files, also
  called a <em>directory tree</em>, there are many different ways to draw
  it.  Here are several ways of depicting the Joss directory tree
  described above that you will see in this course:

  <div style="border: 2px solid black">
    <p>Here's how we might draw it on the board:
    <img src="Joss-dirtree-hand-new.png" alt="Joss directory tree drawn by
  hand" style="display: block; margin: 10px auto; border: 1px solid black; width: 700px">
  </div>

  <div style="border: 2px solid black">
    <p>Here's how it might look on a Mac, using the <em>finder</em>, and
    choosing the <q>list</q> view (second icon on the left, in the group
    of four just above the filenames).
    <img src="Joss-dirtree-mac.png" alt="Joss directory tree on a Mac"
         style="display: block; margin: 10px auto; border: 1px solid black">
  </div>

  <div style="border: 2px solid black">
    <p>Here's how it might look on a Windows machine, using
    the <em>Windows Explorer</em>:
    <img src="Joss-dirtree-win.png" alt="Joss directory tree on Windows"
    style="display: block; margin: 10px auto; border: 1px solid black">
  </div>

<P>For example, we can see that "buffy.html" and "willow.html" are both
files in the same directory, the one called "cast," which is, in turn, one
of three things in the directory called "Buffy," which is in the directory
called "Joss." Joss contains two directories (Buffy and Angel) and a file
called "comics.html"; and so on. Take a minute to be sure you understand
the relationships among the directories and files.  Notice that there
are <em>two</em> files named <q>angel.html</q>; this is okay, because they
are in different directories.

<H2 id="relative">Relative URLs</H2>

<P>We can use these relationships to form a shorthand way of
specifying a URL. This is called a <EM>relative</EM> URL, because we
specify the location of a file relative to a known file. Here are the
basic rules:

<UL>
   <LI>Relative URLs are only for files on the same server.
   Therefore, we can leave off the protocol and server name.
   
   <LI>If a file is in the same directory as the HTML file containing
   the link, we just give its name.  If
   we want to put a link <EM>in</EM> the file <CODE>buffy.html</CODE>
   linking it to <code>willow.html</code>, we can say:
   
<PRE>
&lt;a href="willow.html"&gt;her best friend Willow&lt;/a&gt;
</PRE>
   
   <LI>If a file is in a sibling subdirectory, we can just give the
   path starting from the sibling. So, if we are in the file called
   <code>mythology.html</code> and we want to give a link to the file
   <code>angel.html</code>, we can say:
   
<PRE>
&lt;a href="cast/angel.html"&gt;Angel, the vampire with a soul&lt;/a&gt;
</PRE>
   
   <LI>If the file is in a directory that contains a subdirectory that 
   contains the HTML file with the link,
   we have to go <q>up</q> the tree (go left on the diagram). To go up, we
   write <code>../</code>. That's <q>dot, dot, slash.</q> For example, if we
   are in the file <code>host.html</code> and we want to make a link to
   <code>season3.html,</code> we can say:
   
<PRE>
&lt;a href="../season3.html"&gt;the Host returned in season 3&lt;/a&gt;
</PRE>
   
   That last step, with the <code>..</code> is tricky: to go up, we write
   <code>..</code>; while to go down we have to indicate which subdirectory
   we mean. In either case, we separate these up/down steps with a
   slash. Here's another example: suppose we want to put a link
   from <code>buffy.html</code> to <code>comics.html</code>. In this case,
   we can write:

<PRE>
&lt;a href="../../comics.html"&gt;another layer in the comics&lt;/a&gt;
</PRE>
</UL>

<div class="ex"><span class="ex">Exercise 2</span>
  <P>Create some additional directories in your CS account and practice
with the relative URLs. Relative URLs will make your lives much
easier when you produce different versions and when you deliver your
website to your client. Try the equivalent of:

<UL>
   <LI>A link from <q><code>plot.html</code></q> to <q><code>comics.html</code></q>
   
   <LI>A link from <q><code>season3.html</code></q> to <q><code>plot.html</code></q>
   
   <LI>A link from <q><code>gunn.html</code></q> to <q><code>willow.html</code></q>
</UL>
</div>

<h2 id="fragments">Fragments</h2>

<p>The model above establishes a one-to-one correspondence between a URL
  and a file (web page) somewhere in the vast Internet.  Sometimes,
  however, you want to address (point to) a particular
  location <em>within</em> a page. Such locations are
  called <em>fragments</em>.

<p>While fragments can be used in many ways, one common use is to have
  a <q>table of contents</q> at the top of a page, allowing readers to skip
  down to the particular section they are interested in.  An example of
  such a table of contents is at the top of these notes.

<p>Fragments are addressed by extending the URL by adding a # character
  and the name or id of the fragment.  Thus, we have:

<p>
<TABLE BORDER=1 style="cell-padding: 0px">
      <TR>
         <td><code>http://</code> </td>
         <td><code>cs.wellesley.edu/</code></td>
         <td><code>~cs110/lectures/L03-html/</code></td>
         <td><code>URLs.html#</code></td>
         <td><code>relative</code></td>
      </TR>
      <TR>
      <TR>
         <td>protocol</td>
         <td>server.domain</td>
         <td>path</td>
         <td>filename</td>
         <td>fragment id</td>
      </TR>
  </TABLE>
  
<p>One key step is marking the <em>destination</em> of the URL,
  by <em>naming</em> the fragment, just as we name a file or folder. This
  is done with the <code>ID</code> attribute, which can be applied to
  pretty much every HTML tag.  We typically add it to the header tag (such
  as <code>H2</code>) of the section we want to skip to.  For example:

<pre>
  &lt;h2 id="relative"&gt;Relative URLs&lt;/h2&gt;
</pre>

<p>Given the code above, we can then point to that section from any web
  page anywhere, using an absolute URL, like the one in the table above.
  We can also use fragments with relative URLs.  For example, to point to
  that section from another file in the same directory, we can just give
  the filename and the fragment name: <code>URLs.html#relative</code>. In
  fact, if we want to point to it from within the same file, we can omit
  the filename and the relative URL becomes just <code>#relative</code>.
  You can see examples of that kind of URL in the table of contents at the
  top of this page.
