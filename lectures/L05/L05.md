# Chapter 5: Ottergram using Media Queries

## Homework Advice

* Flexbox is *not* necessary. Flexbox is next. Keep it simple.

## Syllabus Revisions

In response to yesterday's discussion:

* Required student meetings. [Sign-up today!](https://docs.google.com/a/wellesley.edu/spreadsheets/d/1tSV3ucLoJoAhEZTXgopLPGLpGgiUJykMK_rPqFaJ1NY/edit?usp=sharing)
* Change to lateness policy and time/work survey
* Brief discussion of using the lateness policy
* Brief discussion of time reporting
* Randomly assigned class partners. [partners](https://docs.google.com/a/wellesley.edu/spreadsheets/d/1tkECQ1TD7U06hoFkUgdW9nBvOlsAvfOavYYu331qGZM/edit?usp=sharing)

## Absolute and Relative Positioning

Let's return to the [reading on
positioning](../../reading/ch04.html#absolute-and-relative-positioning)
and make sure we understand

* absolute and relative positioning
* Floats
* Centering
* Galleries

## Remaining Quiz Questions from last time

Actually, I think we did all these, but if you want a refresher ...

## Chapter 4 review

We'll start by exploring the solution from
[Chapter 4](../../front-end-dev-resources/book-solutions/Chapter-04b/ottergram/)

You can upload this [chaper 4 tarfile](../../downloads/ch04.tar) to
explore it with me. Note that their version of the solution to Chapter 4
jumps ahead and also provides the solution to Chapter 5, so I've renamed
the solution `Chapter-04b`

```
curl -O http://cs.wellesley.edu/~cs204/downloads/ch04.tar
tar xf ch04.tar
ls Chapter-04b
```

We'll look at the effect of the flexbox styles and the `position:absolute` properties

What questions do you have?

## Recap of Reading

We'll visit the [reading](../../reading/ch05.html) and quickly recap
that. It's pretty short.

## Quiz Questions

[Your questions](../../quizzes/quiz04.html)

## Get started!

You can use the Chapter 4 folder that you uploaded at the beginning of
class as a starting point for today's activities.

Here's our goal for 
[Chapter 5](../../front-end-dev-resources/book-solutions/Chapter-04/ottergram/)

Go head and start on the chapter activities.  

## Bronze Challenge: Landscape layouts

Many times, the narrow dimension is the width, so making an image or other
element `width:100%` makes it as large as possible and preserves the
*aspect ratio*.  We may have to scroll vertically to see additional
content, but people are used to that.

However, in this chapter, they have constrained the height of the page to
the size of the device, and so vertical scrolling won't happen.

If the device is in *portrait* mode, limiting the width of an element,
such as the detail image to 90% works well:

```.detail-image { width: 90% }```

However, if the device is in *landscape* mode, a width of 90% will make
the image too big vertically, overlapping other content.  We'll see this
in class.

If you want something to fit its container vertically, using something
like `height:90%`, there has to be a chain of height settings all the way
to the top of the element tree.

See this [stackoverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1622027/percentage-height-html-5-css)

That's the secret to the bronze challenge. Try it!

Here's [my solution](https://sample-scottdanderson.c9users.io/front-end-dev-resources/book-solutions/Chapter-05b/ottergram/orientation.html)

## Next time

We'll start JavaScript. We *won't* read Chapter 6 for next time, as I
think it tries to pack too much into one chapter. By all means read ahead
if you'd like, but we won't be returning to the book for several class
meetings. We'll just have online readings for the next few meetings before
we attack chapter 6.  We will break chapter 6 into four steps:

1. JavaScript
1. JavaScript Objects and methods
1. JavaScript, jQuery and the DOM,
1. JavaScript and event handlers

They don't use jQuery until later, but I like introducing it earlier.

## End of Class

At the end of each class, I'll hand out paper slips. On it, please write
*your name* and one of the following:

* A question you have about the material of the day
* Something you learned
* A suggestion
* An "I'm okay" statement

## Fun fact

Can you guess who these otters are named after?
