<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>By the end of today, you should:
  <ol>
    <li><p>understand why modularity is useful
    <li><p>write code that can be used in different applications (write once, use many times)
  </ol>
  
<h2>Modularity</h2>

<p>One of the big ideas that we have revisited several times this semester
  is the concept of <em>modularity</em>.  Modularity is important for many
  reasons. Today we will focus on the following aspects of it:
  <ul>
    <li>Modularity allows <em>teams</em> or even large organizations to
    accomplish an enormous task by breaking it into pieces that can be
    accomplished by <em>one</em> person
      
    <li>The pieces have to fit together correctly. This often
    involves <em>standardization</em>.

      <p>The early railroads suffered from incompatibility because
    different rail lines used different widths between the rails, so
    passengers would have to get off one train and board another in order
    to continue their journey.

      <p>Consider what life would be like if every maker of electrical
        appliances used a different plug?

      <p>With software, pieces fit together when the inputs to a function
      are right (the proper datatypes, etc) and the output is correct.

     <li>Ideally, the parts can be <em>generic</em>
     and <em>reuseable</em>. While it's common to have <q>custom</q>
     parts, it's also nice to reuse generic parts with other equipment,
     like borrowing someone's cell phone charger, even a different
     manufacturer!  Similarly, in software, if a function is general, it
     can be used in other software applications.

       <p>In the real world, it's nice when parts are generic and
       reusable, everything from batteries (a D-cell or a AA), nuts and
       bolts, power cords, and so forth.

       <p>Furthermore, this means that the manufacturer can't always
       anticipate how something will be used.

       <p>I often find that students will balk at being asked to implement
       a function because they don't know how it will be used. They want
       to know about its context. Who will be calling it? Why?  While
       those are fine questions, sometimes the answer is <q>you don't need
       to know that,</q> any more than the shopkeeper needs to know what
       device you are putting those D-cells into.

    <li>All this standardization and such doesn't have to inhibit
      creativity. The Eiffel tower is built from generic parts like
      girders and bolts, but the result is unique.

  </ul>

 <h2>Quiz Question Nr. 1</h2>
  <p>Which of the following is <strong>NOT</strong> related to the concept of modularity:
  <ol type="A">
    <li><p>keeping HTML, CSS, and Javacript in separate files
    <li><p>writing functions with parameters and return values
    <li><p>using global variables
    <li><p>using using <code>prompt()</code> to get user input
  </ol>
      
  <h2>Quiz Question Nr. 2</h2>
  <p>We should use modularity...
  <ol type="A">
    <li><p>When we're part of a big tech company providing an API
    <li><p>When we're part of a team of programmers
    <li><p>When we're working alone
    <li><p>all of the above
  </ol> 

  <h2>Quiz Question Nr. 3</h2>
  <p>A "module" is:
  <ol type="A">
    <li><p>A package of simple, neat, clean code that can easily be edited.
    <li><p>an internal style sheet that allows style changes to be easily made
    <li><p>HTML code that can be easily copied and edited.
    <li><p>distinct, separable code that can be used more than once.
  </ol> 

  <h2>Quiz Question Nr. 4</h2>
  <p>Two people are defining functions that will depend on each other
  (e.g, each function invokes the other). Which of the following is TRUE?
  <ol type="A">
    <li><p>The two people need to agree on the names of the functions and
    the names of the parameters
    <li><p>The two people need to agree on the names of the functions but
    not the names of the parameters
    <li><p>The two people need to agree on the names of the parameters but
    not the names of the functions
    <li><p>The two people do not need to agree on either the names of the
    functions or the parameters
  </ol> 


<h2>The Modularity Challenge</h2>
      
<p><a href="/~ehildret/">Prof. Ellen Hildreth</a> created a cool way to experience modularity in the CS110 course.
There are two applications that use a set of six JavaScript functions

<h2 id="sec_summary">Summary</h2>
<p>We hope that after these activities:
  <ul>
    <li>understand the concept of modularity and its benefits</li>  
    <li>can compose a program of parts written by many people and have it work in different ways</li>  
  </ul>

<p>Students working in teams write some code that went missing, which if added to 
  two different pages, contributes into making these applications complete. The cool 
  thing that the same identical code is used by <strong>both</strong> applications.
