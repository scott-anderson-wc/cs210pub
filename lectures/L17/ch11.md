# Chapter 11, Data to DOM

Today we will learn how to use jQuery to dynamically update the document
(sometimes called the DOM, somewhat confusingly).

On Friday, we'll backtrack a bit to learn about Grid Systems, Skeleton and
Bootstrap.  You might want to re-read Chapter 9, this time focussing on
the Bootstrap aspects.

## Sakai

I've updated your grades in Sakai

I've also made, I think, all the other updates. Please check. I don't want
to hear about mistakes 10 minutes before grades are due. :-)

## Midterm

We only got to Q5 before the formatting broke, so we'll pick it up from
there.

## A5 Sliding Tiles Solution

I'll have a paper handout. Here's the live game, and I will show you the
source.

[A5 solution](../../solutions/a05-sliding-tiles/tile-game.html)

## Assignment 7 and Modules

I'll demo [A07 signup form](../../solutions/a07-signup/signup.html), and
we'll discuss this aspect of the implementation:

```
:::JavaScript
var Luhn = (function () {

    function digits_of(number,step,init) {
        ....
    }
    
    function sum(array) {
        ...
    }

    function checksum(card_number) {
        ...
    } 

    function is_valid(card_number) {
        return checksum(card_number) == 0;
    }
    
    function test() {
        console.log('should be true:  '+is_valid('79927398713'));
        console.log('should be false: '+is_valid('79927398714'));
    }
    
    // here are the exported values
    return { checksum: checksum, is_valid: is_valid, test: test };
})();
```

Let's see that in the browser, here: [Luhn.html](Luhn.html)

Let's compare that with Python code:

```
:::Python
def digits_of(number):
    return [int(i) for i in str(number)]

def luhn_checksum(card_number):
    digits = digits_of(card_number)
    odd_digits = digits[-1::-2]
    even_digits = digits[-2::-2]
    total = sum(odd_digits)
    for digit in even_digits:
        total += sum(digits_of(2 * digit))
    return total % 10

def is_luhn_valid(card_number):
    return luhn_checksum(card_number) == 0
```

To use this module, our main Python file would do

```
:::Python
import luhn

print luhn.luhn_checksum('1234')  # returns a number
print luhn.is_luhn_valid('1234')  # returns boolean
```    

If you're using modules, you'd probably omit `luhn` from the function
names!

Let's draw a picture of this as well as seeing it in the Python REPL.

Our JavaScript works pretty much the same way, only it uses better naming
and is explicit about exports.  

## Modules in Assignment 7

Working with and defining modules is key to this assignment

Your HTML will load three files:

1. `Luhn.js`; you'll make only a tiny change to this file
1. `formhandler.js`; you'll make some small changes to this file
1. `signup.js`; this file will be similar to the `main.js` file from
Chapter 10, in that it will *use* functions and objects defined in the
other files.  By working with both sides of the abstraction barriers, I
hope you'll feel more comfortable with modules in general and modules in JavaScript.

Let's draw a picture of this.

## Chapter Demo

Here's what coffeerun looks like at the end of [chapter 11](../../front-end-dev-resources/book-solutions/Chapter-11/coffeerun/index.html)

## Chapter Recap

This chapter covers the following ideas and techniques:

1. Creating branches of structure (HTML elements with attributes) and
adding them to the document. Coffeerun does this to add checkboxes for
pending orders
1. Adding an event handler for elements that finds the appropriate node by
searching up/down the tree. They add a click handler to indicate that a
coffee order is complete that removes it from the tree.
1. delegating the event handler to a static ancestor. They add the click
handler to a container DIV.
1. Some complicated modularity. Note that there is a `Row` constructor
that is entirely private to the `CheckList` module, which is
global`. We'll look at the code in [checklist.js](../../front-end-dev-resources/book-solutions/Chapter-11/coffeerun/scripts/checklist.js)

## Creating elements

We can build a simple node like this:

`$("<form>")`

(jQuery is smart enough to do the right thing, so the closing tag is optional.)

To build a node with attributes, supply a JS object literal with the
attribute names and values:

`$("<input></input>", {'type': 'checkbox', 'value': 'fred'})`

You *could* put the attributes into the same string with the tag, but then
you have to worry about embedded quotation marks and such. It's usually
easier to let jQuery construct the element for you, *especially* if any of
the attributes or their values are *dynamic*.

We put these together using jQuery's `.append()` method:

```
:::JavaScript
var $form = $("<form>", {'method':'post', 'action': url});
var $input = $("<input></input>",
               {'type': 'checkbox', 'value': 'fred'});
$form.append($input);
```
Here's the book's code for adding a row containing a checklist. Note that
the value of the checkbox is a dynamic value.

```
:::JavaScript
  function Row(coffeeOrder) {
    var $div = $('<div></div>', {
      'data-coffee-order': 'checkbox',
      'class': 'checkbox'
    });

    var $label = $('<label></label>');

    var $checkbox = $('<input></input>', {
      type: 'checkbox',
      value: coffeeOrder.emailAddress
    });

    var description = coffeeOrder.size + ' ';
    if (coffeeOrder.flavor) {
      description += coffeeOrder.flavor + ' ';
    }
    description += coffeeOrder.coffee + ', ';
    description += ' (' + coffeeOrder.emailAddress + ')';
    description += ' [' + coffeeOrder.strength + 'x]';

    $label.append($checkbox);
    $label.append(description);
    $div.append($label);

    this.$element = $div;   // somebody else adds it to the DOM
  }
```

You can send an arbitrary string of HTML to jQuery to build into
structure, but I don't recommend this. Using a more structured approach
avoids difficult-to-find bugs.

Here's what they built:

<figure>
   <img src="coffeerun-ch11.png">
   <figcaption>Coffee Run at the end of Chapter 11</figcaption>
</figure>

## Searching Down and Up the Tree:

Their code from the chapter:

```
:::JavaScript
  CheckList.prototype.removeRow = function (email) {
    this.$element                                 // start here
      .find('[value="' + email + '"]')            // search down
      .closest('[data-coffee-order="checkbox"]')  // then up
      .remove();                                  // and act
  };
```

This example also shows the power of jQuery.

## Event Delegation

Event delegation is designed for dynamically changing lists.

Put an event handler on a static ancestor and delegate all the event
handling to it. 

This works because events *bubble* up the tree of a document.

In the coffeerun example, the event will bubble up from the checkbox to
the checklist container:

```
 <div data-coffee-order="checklist">            
 </div>
```

Their code that uses event delegation and `bind`, so the `this` in the
event handler is a `CheckList` object.

```
:::JavaScript
  CheckList.prototype.addClickHandler = function (fn) {
    this.$element.on('click', 'input', function (event) {
      var email = event.target.value;
      this.removeRow(email);
      fn(email);
    }.bind(this));
  };
```

## Questions

I'll answer [your questions](../../quizzes/quiz14.html)

## Book Activities

Let's take the remaining time to do the activities in Chapter 11.

Remember, the goal is to understand the point of each step, so please
discuss with your partner and ask me if you have any questions. Don't
just go through the motions.

## Input Values

In Chapter 10, we learned how to serialize all of a form's values into an
array of objects, and then iterate over that array to assemble them all
into a single object.

That's a fine technique, but if you just want *one* value, there's an
easier way. jQuery has a [`.val()`](https://api.jquery.com/val/) method
that can get and set the value of an input:

To get the value, assuming you can select the control:

`$(selector).val()`

This method works on `input` elements, `select` (drop-down menus), and 
`textarea` elements.

For radio buttons and checkboxes, you can use the `:checked` pseudo-class
to get the value of the one(s) that was checked:

`$('input[type=radio][name=size]:checked').val();`

You'll need to use `.val()` for the next assignment (assignment 8)

## Cloning

If you're creating a *lot* of structure, even the compact jQuery code can
become a little tedious. Instead, we can use *cloning*:

```
<div id="template">
   <div data-coffee-order="checkbox" class="checkbox">
       <label><input type="checklist" value=""></label>
   </div>
</div>

 <div data-coffee-order="checklist">            
 </div>
```

With cloning, you can copy all that structure, modify it, and then graft
it onto the document:

```
:::JavaScript
function makeRow(coffeeOrder) {
    var $clone = $("#template > div").clone();
    var desc = ...;
    $clone.find("label").append(desc);
    $clone.find("input").attr("value",coffeeOrder.emailAddress);
    $element.append($clone);
}
```

The template HTML could be much more complex, and the code to clone,
modify, and append it doesn't get any more complex.
