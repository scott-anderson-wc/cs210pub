<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>By the end of today, you will be able to:
  <ol>
    <li>write <em>cascading if</em> statements
    <li>use media queries for responsive design</li>
  </ol>

<h2>Getting to know the JS Console</h2>

<p>The JS Console is very important:
<ul>
  <li>It's where error messages are printed
    
  <li>It's where <code>console.log</code> messages are printed
    
  <li>It's where you can type in bits of code just to see what they do.
</ul>

<p>In general, you should always have the JS console open when you are
  coding JS.

<p>You owe it to yourself to learn the keyboard shortcut for opening the
  JS console. I do it a zillion times a day, and if I can save myself 5
  seconds each time...

<p>Command-option-j on the Macs will do the trick. Do that now, please.

<h2>Datatypes Matter</h2>

<p>Look at each of the following expressions and guess their value. Write
  down your predictions. (This is important, so that you will notice if
  you are wrong.) Then, type or copy/paste the expressions into the JS
  console and see if you were right.

<pre>
3 &lt; 11;
"3" &lt; "11";
3 &lt; "11";
</pre>

<p>Hunh? What does this all mean?
  <ul>
    <li>The first compares two <em>numbers</em>.
      
    <li>The second compares two <em>strings</em>, which uses a character
    by character comparison, like "ax" &lt; "cab"
      
    <li>The third compares a number and a string. What happens then?
  </ul>

<p>The take-home message is that if you are treating things as numbers,
  make sure they are numbers, not strings.

<h2>If statements</h2>

<p>We'll return to the last two exercises from last time (the time-based
ones).


<h2>Cascading IF Statements</h2>

<p>We saw this in the reading:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
    if (grade &gt;= 90) {
        letterGrade = "A";
    } else if (grade &gt;= 80) {
        letterGrade = "B";
    } else if (grade &gt;= 70) {
        letterGrade = "C";
    } else if (grade &gt;= 60) {
        letterGrade = "D";
    } else {
        letterGrade = "F";
    }
</pre>
  
<h2>Quiz Question Nr. 1</h2>

<p>We all know that a B is a grade between 80 and 90 (at least in
  this example), but the code above does <em>not</em> check that the grade is
  less than 90!  Is that okay?

<ol type="A">
    <li><p>It's okay, the <code>letterGrade</code> variable gets overwritten by the correct value</p></li>
    <li><p>It's okay, the test comes after the test for A</p></li>
    <li><p>It's okay, the test comes in the <code>else</code> </p></li>
    <li><p>Oops, that's a bug in the code!</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Exercise on Page Width</h2>

<p>Suppose we want to categorize a screen as "narrow", "medium" or "wide",
  storing the result in a variable called "screenKind". Imagine we do it
  this way:

<ul>
  <li>wide:  wider than 960px
    
  <li>medium:  480-960
    
  <li>narrow:  0-480
</ul>

<p>Your code should prompt the user for the screen width.  (But, you
  should know that there is a built-in <code>screen.availWidth</code>
  global variable that contains this info.)

<p>You might come up with something like this:

<div class="hidden_from_student">
  <pre id="act1_src" class="prettyprint lang-js executable">
var width = parseInt(prompt("Enter screen width in pixels"));
if( width >= 960 ) {
    screenKind = "wide";
} else if( width > 480 ) {
    screenKind = "medium";
} else {
    screenKind = "narrow";
}
  </pre>
</div>

<p>Is 480 narrow or medium?

<h2>Cascaded IF Summary</h2>

<p>If you use <code>if-else</code>, you don't have to test for the
  negation of something.

<p>Don't test for things that you know are true. If you know that a coin
  flip is not <em>heads</em>, you don't have to test that
  it's <em>tails</em>.

<p>Even more generally, keep your code as simple as possible.  If you're
  given someone's age, you don't have to test that it's a positive number.
  Professional code is littered with "sanity checks" like that, but even
  the pros find that annoying.  For us, let's focus on the important
  conditions.</p>

<h2>Responsive Design</h2>    

<p>Let's refresh some CSS knowledge.      
          
    <h2>Quiz Question Nr. 2</h2> 
<p>You're given the following CSS rule:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
  div p {
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 500px;
  }
</pre>
<p>When will the elements <code>p</code> within the <code>div</code> have
  exactly the width 500px?</p>
<ol type="A">
  <li>Always</li>
  <li>When the parent's width is less than 500px</li>
  <li>When the parent's width is more than 500px</li>
</ol>
          
<h2>Quiz Question Nr. 3</h2> 

<p>How can you read the following CSS rule (called a media query) in English:</p>
      
<pre class="prettyprint">
@media handheld and (max-width: 600px) {
      /* ... */
}
</pre>
      
<ol type="A">
  <li>all media elements in a handheld device cannot have a width more than 600px</li>
  <li>set all media elements in a page to at least 600px of width</li>
  <li>if the media type is a handheld device and the display's width is greater than 600px do</li>
  <li>if the media type is a handheld device and the display's width is up to 600px do</li>
</ol>
      
<div class="alert alert-warning">

    <h4>Media Query</h4>  
      To learn about media types, their properties and how to create media query rules read more at
      <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp">W3 Schools</a>. 
</div>  
     
<h2>Responsive Design Example</h2>

<p>You have an opportunity to take a web page with a fixed-width design
  and convert it to responsive design that changes appearance based on the
  width of the device. Download
  <a href="foxes.zip">this
    folder</a> that contains the HTML file and three images. Unzip it on your Desktop. Or, get the files one at a time from the <a href="foxes">directory</a></p> 
  
     <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Change the CSS for the element <code>wrapper</code> to move from
    fixed-width to fluid width. (Note the margin property with 3 values:
    top left-and-right bottom.)
        
      
  <div class="row">
   <div class="col-md-5"> 
     <pre class="prettyprint">
#wrapper {
  width: 960px;
  margin: -10px auto 0;
  background-color: #FFEFDF;
}
</pre>
     <p>Original Version</p>
     </div>
      <div class="col-md-5"> 
        <pre class="prettyprint">
#wrapper {
  max-width: 960px;
  width: 100%;
  margin: -10px auto 0;
  background-color: #FFEFDF;
}
</pre>
        <p>Modified Version</p>
</div>
</div>
 <h4>Ask yourself</h4>     
     <p>What does it mean for the <code>wrapper</code> to have a width of 100%?</p> 
 <p>Resize the page after this change. What do you see?</p>     
 <h3>Step 2</h3>     
 <p>The banner image is not changing because the image width is also 960px. When the page
   becomes smaller than the image, a horizontal scrollbar is added. We can force the banner image
   to change its width with the page by creating a rule to set it to 100%. Do that now and test
   the result.
   
  <h3>Step 3</h3>
   <p>After the first two steps, the page text flows with the page and the banner image shrinks too when
     we resize. The biggest problem for the moment is the navbar. Let's look at its code:
     
   <pre class="prettyprint">
nav ul li {
  list-style-type: none;
  display: inline-block;
  text-align: center;
  width: 137px;
  padding: 20px 0;
}
   </pre>  
 <p>Every value in pixels for the width property is a problem for the fluid design, 
      we need to convert it to a % value.
      How do we do that?</p>
      
      <h4>Ask yourself</h4>
      <p>The value 137px doesn't seem random. Why is every list item of the navbar set to 137px? What is 
      the corresponding in %? Make that change into the code and test the page.</p>
   
 <h3>Step 4</h3>     
  <p>The menu items are showing in a horizontal line because of the property <code>display: inline-block;</code>.
      If you were to delete the word "inline", you'd see them stacking vertically. However, this is not a behavior
      you want from the beginning. We want this only when the screen is small. In this case we will need a media 
      query rule.</p>  
      
  <pre class="prettyprint">
 @media screen and (max-width: 680px){
    nav ul li {
      display: block;
      width: 100%; /* let's fill all available space*/
      padding: 1% 0; /* 1% of width of element*/
      border-bottom: 1px solid white;
    }
  }
  </pre>
   <p>Add this rule to the page and resize it. </p>  
      
<h3>Step 5</h3>
<p>We're almost done. If you resize to a small width, you'll see the images sticking out left and right.
      This can also be fixed with the following media query:</p>  
      <pre class="prettyprint">
@media screen and (max-width: 480px) {
  #text img {width: 100%};
}
      </pre>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>We hope that after these activities you have a good understanding of:
  <ul>
    <li>Using cascading "if" statements, and avoiding unnecessary tests.
    <li>using media queries to create responsive design

  </ul>
