<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>By the end of today, you should:
  <ol>
    <li>understand the terminology used when talking about encryption, decryption, and cryptography<p>
    <li>understand encryption systems that use private keys and public keys<p>
    <li>use public key encryption for your own communication<p>
    <li>be informed of the different uses of private and public key cryptography
  </ol>

<h2>Encryption Recap</h2>

<p>Foundation
  <ul>
    <li>What makes general-purpose encryption <em>possible</em> is
      that <em>everything</em> can be represented using <em>bits</em>. This
      is crucially important. 
    <li>Encryption just works on the bits; it doesn't care whether the
      bits are text, images, sound, movies, or anything else
  </ul>

<p>Kinds of Encryption:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Symmetric</strong> or <strong>private key</strong> encryption.  The idea is relatively
    intuitive, even if the implementations are complex. Examples:
      <ul>
        <li>Caesar,
          
        <li>Vigenere,
          
        <li>Enigma
          
      </ul>

      <p>The weakness of private key encryption is <em>the key
      distribution</em> problem:
        <blockquote><p>How do you securely transmit the <em>secret
        key</em> to your interlocutor so that you can securely communicate
        with them?
        </blockquote>
      
    <li><strong>Public key</strong> or <strong>asymmetric</strong>
    encryption. The idea is revolutionary.
      <ul>
        <li>Solves the <em>key distribution problem</em>
          
        <li>How do you prove who you are without giving away your
          identity?  Solved!

        <li>Allows for <em>digital signatures</em>, which
          an <em>amazing</em> technology. 
          <blockquote>
            <p>How can you <q>sign</q> a document without allowing others
              to forge your signature or to copy/paste your signature onto
              another document?  Solved!
          </blockquote>
          <p>We'll cover digital signatures next time.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
  </ul>

  <h2>Communication using Symmetric Encryption</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Alice and Bob somehow share a secret key, K, that Eve does not
      
    <li>Alice composes a message, M, to Bob. She encrypts it with the
    key.  She sends E<sub>K</sub>(M) to Bob.
        
    <li>The function E is a mathematical function that maps plaintext
        bitstrings to ciphertext bitstrings. It doesn't matter whether the
        bitstring is text, images, sounds, movies, or anything else.
      
    <li>Bob decrypts it with K by computing
      D<sub>K</sub>(E<sub>K</sub>(M)) = M and reads the message.
      
    <li>He can reply the same way.
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Communication using Public Key Encryption</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Alice creates a key <em>pair</em> (P,S).  They
    are <em>inverses</em>:  S can decrypt what P encrypts (and vice
    versa).
      
    <li>Alice sends Bob her public key, P. She can send a copy to Eve,
      too.
      
    <li>Bob composes a message, M to Alice.  He encrypts it with P.  He
    sends E<sub>P</sub>(M) to Alice.

    <li>Alice decrypts it with the secret key, computing
      D<sub>S</sub>(E<sub>P</sub>(M)) = M and reads the message.
  </ul>

<p>The trick is to come up with algorithms and key pairs where knowing P
  doesn't help Eve find S.

<p>One such trick is factoring, which is the basis of the RSA
  (Rivest-Shamir-Adelman method).  If P is the product of
  two <em>very</em> large prime numbers, and S is related to those prime
  factors, Eve can only find S by factoring P.

<h2>Task 1: Play the RSA game with a friend</h2>      
 
<p>For simplicity, I may just demo this on a single machine, but you can
    test that I'm not cheating by doing the exercise.

<div class="ex">
  <h2 id="rsa_exercise1">Exercise Exploring RSA</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Go
    to <a href="http://www.hanewin.net/encrypt/rsa/rsa-test.htm">Herbert
    Hanewinkel's RSA page</a>. (If that's down or missing, you can use
    this <a href="RSA-Public-Key-Encryption-Demo.html">local copy</a>.
      
    <li>From the pulldown menu, choose a number of bits. This is the
    number of bits that n will be (approximately), and, because factoring
    n is the hard part, the bigger n, the stronger the encryption scheme.

    <p>(FYI, 2048 bits is considered barely acceptable for commercial
    websites, but takes 90+ seconds to compute on my office desktop
    computer, whereas 1024 bits takes just 5 seconds.)
      
    <li>click on <q>generate key</q>

    <li>Notice how big the <q>Public Modulo (p*q)</q> is.  This is the
    value of n. Imagine trying to factor that to get p and q!

    <li>Skip down to below the solid line to the pair of boxes labeled
    <q>plaintext</q> and <q>ciphertext in hex</q>.  (Notice how you now
    understand what <q>hex</q> means: since the encryption is going to be
    a long string of bits, hex is incredibly useful here..)

    <li>Type in a message (plaintext) and encrypt it.  Erase the plaintext
    and decrypt it.
  </ol>
</div>

<div class="ex">
  <h2 id="rsa_exercise">Exercise Using the RSA Cipher</h2>

  <p>Let's make this a bit more realistic.  Choose a partner (say from the
  row in front of or behind you, so you can't easily look onto her
  monitor, though it doesn't really matter).  One of you will be
  the <em>sender</em> and the other the <em>receiver</em>.
    <ol>
      <li>The <em>receiver</em> uses this
        customized <a target="_blank" href="rsa-secret.html">receiver</a> version of Herbert
      Hanewinkel's form to create a key pair.q

      <li>She transmits the public key to the sender.  Specifically, she
      sends the last field of the form above the horizontal line, the
      input labeled <q>OpenPGP Multi Precision Integer (MPI) of Public Key
      (base64)</q>.  (This is an encoding of both e and n, in one
      relatively compact representation.)

          <li>(For a less-realistic but faster short-cut, just use two
          different browsers on the same machine, say Chrome and
          Firefox. One is the sender and one is the receiver. You can then
          just copy/paste between browsers instead of using email.)
        
      <li>The sender copies the packed public key into this
      customized <a target="_blank" href="rsa-public.html">public</a>
      version of the RSA encryption form.  She clicks on the button to
      unpack e and n from the public key.
        
      <li>The sender encrypts her message. The message can be anything.
          It doesn't even have to be private.  If you're feeling stumped,
          send the identity of the important character who dies
          in <i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i> and who kills
          him.  This is an important secret; don't assume everyone has
          read the book.

      <li>The sender then copy/pastes the ciphertext into an email message
        and emails it to the receiver.

      <li>The receiver copy/pastes the ciphertext into the same RSA form,
      above (the one that knows the decryption key) and decrypts the
      message.

      <li>Verify that the message was transmitted correctly and secretly.
    </ol>
</div>

<p>Notice the contrast between using public key and private key
  encryption.  In private key encryption, as with Caesar and
  Vigen&egrave;re, both the sender and receiver have the key and do pretty
  much the same thing.  Thus, codes like that are
  called <em>symmetric</em> cryptosystems.  In public key encryption, on
  the other hand, the sender and receiver do very different things.  The
  receiver has to generate the public key that allows her to receive
  messages that only she can read; the sender doesn't know anything that
  Eve doesn't know.  Thus, public key systems are also
  called <em>asymmetric</em> cryptosystems.

      
  <h2>Quiz Question Nr. 8</h2>
  <p>Public key encryption is useful because:
  <ol type="A">
    <li><p>it is used by people who want to keep their communication secret from the government
    <li><p>it is used by websites such as Google, Facebook, Tumblr, etc.
    <li><p>it is used for financial transactions on the web
    <li><p>all of the above
  </ol> 

<p>But, of course, the most important thing it does is solve the <em>key
    distribution problem</em>.

  <h2>Quiz Question Nr. 9</h2>
  <p>Which of the following is TRUE:
  <ol type="A">
    <li><p>the public key encrypts a message that is decrypted by the private key
    <li><p>the private key encrypts a message that is decrypted by the public key
    <li><p>both A and B
    <li><p>neither A nor B
  </ol> 
      

<h2 id="sec_summary">Summary</h2>
<p>We hope that after these activities you can:
  <ul>
    <li>understand how encryption and decryption work
    <li>understand the difference between private and publick key cryptography
    <li>the uses of private and public key cryptography
  </ul>
