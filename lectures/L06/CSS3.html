          <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
          <p>The newest version of CSS, CSS3, has added several features (such as the WebFonts that we 
          have already discussed), which make CSS more powerful. In these notes,
          we will show examples of other beautiful effects you can achieve with CSS3, such as 
            creating sophisticated text shadows, composing
            background scenes with multiple background images, using images as borders for 
            elements, and applying rounded corners and box shadows. 
            CSS3 has more features that 
            we are not able to cover in detail, but you should be aware of them and 
            try them out to see whether they might be useful to you in the future,
            especially when you design the pages of your project.
          </p>
         <div class="alert alert-danger">
           <h4>Important Note</h4>
           Many of the CSS3 new features are still browser-specific. Thus, we often
           will need to
           add a browser-specific prefix for <em>some</em> of the new CSS3 properties
           to display properly. 
           For Chrome
           and Safari the prefix is <code>-webkit-</code> (Webkit is the name of 
           the rendering engine that these browsers use). For Firefox the prefix
           is <code>-moz-</code>, for Internet Explorer is <code>-ms-</code>,
           and for Opera is <code>-o-</code>.
        </div>
          
          
        <h2 id="text">Text Effects</h2> 
         <p>Text properties have been from the beginning part of CSS: color, text-align,
          text-decoration, text-indent, text-transform, letter-spacing, line-height,
          <a href= "http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/playit.asp?filename=playcss_vertical-align">
          vertical-align</a>, word-spacing, etc.
          
          <p>CSS3 expanded the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text/">Text Module</a>
          to specify several new text effects, which unfortunately, haven't been 
            adopted yet by the browsers. The ones that are working are: text-shadow, 
            <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss3_word-break">word-break</a>,
            and 
            <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss3_word-wrap">word-wrap</a>.
              You can look up the latter two properties on your own (very simple to understand), and 
              we will explain here the <code>text-shadow</code> property.
            </p>
          
          <p>CSS uses the <em>Cartesian coordinate system</em>, depicted below.</p>
          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-6">
                <figure class="text-center">
                  <img src="images/coordinates.png" alt="cartesian coordinate system"
                 class="img-thumbnail">
                  <figcaption>Figure 1: Cartesian coordinate system</figcaption>
                  </figure>
              </div>
            
              <div class="col-md-6" >
                <p style="margin-top: 100px">In Figure 1, 
                  we see the x-axis and y-axis overlaid in a grid. Imagine
                that each square corresponds to a single pixel. The distance from the
                origin can be measured either positively or negatively. Then, 
                the <em>coordinates</em> of a pixel are a pair of values (one for each axis), 
                which indicate the distance from the origin. 
                <strong>In CSS, the default origin is the top-left corner of an element.</strong>
                  </p>
              </div>
          </div> <!-- end of two-column row--> 
          
        <p>Now that we know how to express distances in pixels, we can explain the
          <code>text-shadow</code> property. Let's start with an example:</p>
            <p id="shadow1" style="text-align: center;">
              WELLESLEY
          </p>
        <p>As you can notice, the shadow drops rights below.
          This can be explained by positive values for both x and y coordinates,
          where the new shadowed text will be placed with the respect to 0,0 (
          the origin, which is the top-left corner of the original text). 
          This is the rule we wrote:
          </p>
          
          <pre>
#shadow1 { 
    font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;
    color: red;
    text-shadow: 3px 3px #FF7373;
}
</pre>
          The syntax for assigning values to the <code>text-shadow</code> property looks like this:
     
          <pre>
selector { text-shadow: <em>x y blur-radius color</em>; }
</pre>
         <p><em>x</em> is the horizontal distance from the text (x-offset), <em>y</em> is 
          the vertical distance from the text (y-offset), <em>blur-radius</em> sets the extent
          of the blur effect on the shadow (the higher the value the wider the blur), 
          <em>color</em> can be whatever value you like (we'll talk about color representation
          very soon). If you don't specify a value for the blur-radius, the default value is 0.</p> 
          
          Here is an example of using the blur-radius:
          
           <p id="shadow2" style="text-align: center;">
              WELLESLEY
          </p>
          
          <p>which was created with this CSS rule:</p>
  <pre>
#shadow2 {
        color: white;        
        font-size: 50pt;
        font-family: Times;
        text-shadow: 0 -4px 10px blue;
      }
</pre>        
  
          <p>Finally, it is possible to apply several shadows to text, to create more
          interesting effects:</p>
          
          <p id="shadow3" style="text-align: center;">WELLESLEY</p>
      
        This is the CSS rule for this effect:
<pre>
#shadow3 {
        text-shadow: 0 -2px 3px #FFF, /* white */
                     0 -4px 3px #AAA, /* light gray */
                     0 -6px 6px #666, /* dark gray */
                     0 -8px 9px #000; /* black */
        font-size: 50pt;
      }
</pre>
          
          
        <h2 id="background">Background Images</h2>
          <p>You have already seen the property <code>background-image</code> in a few
          examples. CSS3 makes possible to have multiple images
          on the background, which can be used to create interesting effects.</p>
          
          <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
            <h4>Single background image</h4>
          <p>Here is the <a href="css3_examples/ex1.html">example of a page with one 
            background image</a>, which was generated with this CSS rule:</p>
          <pre>
header {
  height: 640px;
  background: url('images/blue-sky.jpg') no-repeat;
}
</pre>
        <p>The <code>no-repeat</code> value is especially useful when an image is small and
          the browser automatically repeats it to fill the whole background space. Without
          that value, the background will look like in <a href="css3_examples/ex1-1.html">
          this example</a>.          
          Additionally,
          because the <code>header</code> element doesn't have a box size (no content), we 
          will need to specify the <code>height</code> property for it, otherwise, nothing 
            will be displayed.</p>  
          </div>
          
          <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
            <h4>Multiple background images</h4>
          To make things more interesting we can add other images on top of an existing background
            image, again, only using CSS3.
            <p>Here is a new page created  by <a href="css3_examples/ex2.html">adding the bird 
              on the blue sky</a> from the previous two examples.</p>
            
          <p>This is the CSS rule we used:</p>
<pre>
header {
  height: 640px;
  background: url('images/bird.png') no-repeat,
              url('images/blue-sky.jpg') no-repeat; 
}
</pre>            
        <p>Notice that we use a <code>,</code> to list all images that we want to appear
            in the background. The order in which the images appear in this list is
            very important. The image that needs to be behind everything else should be
            last in this list as well. 
          </div>
          
        <p>However, in order for the effect to look nice,
            the foreground images need to have <em>transparent</em> background themselves.
            Here is how our bird image looks like if you open it with a image processing
            tool:</p>
            <figure class="text-center">
              <img src="images/bird_transparent.png" alt="image of a bird"
                   class="img-thumbnail">
            </figure>
 
        <p>The <code>background</code> property has multipe subproperties that 
          are useful to create more interesting effects. For example, using
          <code>background-position</code> we can place our bird in any 
          location over the blue skye. Here is the <a href="css3_examples/ex2-1.html">
          center bottom example</a>.
          </p>
          <p>We needed to add one line to our CSS rule:</p>
          <pre>
header {
  height: 640px;
  background: url('images/bird.png') no-repeat, 
              url('images/blue-sky.jpg') no-repeat; 
  <strong>background-position: center bottom, 0% 0%;</strong>
}
</pre>
          <p>Because there are two images, we specify the position for both of them. This
          property takes several values and you can play with them in this 
          <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/playit.asp?filename=playcss_background-position">
          interactive example from the W3Schools</a>.
          </p>
          
          <p>Additionally, by using another property, <code>background-size</code>, we
          can compose scenes with multiple images, as shown in this 
            <a href="css3_examples/ex2-2.html">example with many 
          flying birds</a>.</p>
          
          <pre>
header {
  height: 640px;
  background: url('images/bird.png') no-repeat 5% 105%, 
              url('images/bird.png') no-repeat 20% 60%, 
              url('images/bird.png') no-repeat 40% 80%, 
              url('images/bird.png') no-repeat 60% 40%, 
              url('images/bird.png') no-repeat 70% 45%, 
              url('images/bird.png') no-repeat 60% 50%, 
              url('images/blue-sky.jpg') no-repeat 50% 50%; 
  background-size: auto, 10%, 10%, 5%, 5%, 5%,  auto;
}
</pre>
          
          <p>The <code>background-size</code> property can also 
            <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_background-size.asp">
              take values of different kinds</a>. The values in % shown in our
          example, refer to the size of the parent element of the background, in this case
          <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>. Since its size is 960x650 pixels, a 10% image will show as
          96x65 pixels. Finally, notice that in this example, we have added the 
          <code>background-position</code> values to each image (after <code>no-repeat</code>).
            Each of the pairs shows the left and top coordinate for where the image
            is placed.
          </p>
          
        <h2 id="borders">Borders and Box Effects</h2>  
        <p>While the ability to style a border was in CSS from the very beginning,
          designers always wanted to do more than manipulate the color, size, or 
          <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_border-style.asp">style</a>
          (dotted, dashed, solid, etc.) for their elements.
          </p>
          <p>CSS3 adds several features that designers where trying to achieve with lots of 
          <q>hacks</q> involving extra markup in the HTML page, namely: rounded corners, 
          images for borders, and box shadows. We look into each of these properties in 
          the following.</p>
          
        <h3>Rounded Corners</h3>
          <p>CSS3 introduces a way to round the corners of your elements using CSS alone. 
          Each corner is treated as a quarter ellipse, which is defined by a curve that 
          is drawn between a point on the x-axis and a point on the y-axis, as shown in
          the left graph below. A quarter ellipse can be regular, which means the length 
          along both axes is the same, or irregular, which means the length along each axis is different 
            (see graph on the right).
          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-6">
                <figure class="text-center">
                  <img src="images/quarter.png" alt="quarter ellipse"
                 class="img-thumbnail">
                  <figcaption>A quarter ellipse made by the curve between lengths on the x and y axes.</figcaption>
                  </figure>
              </div>
            
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <figure class="text-center">
                  <img src="images/rounded.png" alt="example of rounded corners"
                 class="img-thumbnail">
                  <figcaption>A regular curve (left) has identical values on both axes; 
                    an irregular curve has different values on each axis.
                  </figcaption>
                  </figure>
              </div>
           </div>
            <p>CSS3 introduced the <code>border-radius</code> property to implement the rounded
            corners. Similar to the <code>border</code> property that can be specified by
            <code>-top</code>, <code>-right</code>, <code>-bottom</code>, and <code>-left</code>,
            we can specifiy the x and y values for each corner separately. Below is a concrete
            example:</p>
            
            <pre>
div {
    border-top-left-radius: 20px; 
    border-top-right-radius: 20px; 
    border-bottom-right-radius: 20px; 
    border-bottom-left-radius: 20px;
}
</pre>
            <p>If only one value has been specified, that means that both x and y are using
            the same radius. Otherwise, we will specify two values in every line. 
              Clearly, if the radius is the same for all corners, we can simply
            write the rule as: <code>{border-radius: 20px; }</code>. Additionally,
              we can use the shorthand syntax to specify different values for x and y
              using this syntax: <code>border-radius: { horizontal-radius / vertical-radius; }</code>,
              where each side of the slash can contain between one and four values, as with the 
              shorthand for regular curves.           
            </p>
            
            <p>We have grouped different uses of this rule in one single page of 
              <a href="css3_examples/ex4.html">rounded corner
            examples</a>. Use the "View Source" on the browser (or Inspect Element) to
            look at the syntax for every rule and what it achieves on the page.</p>

 
          
        <h3>Border Images</h3>  
          <p>Similarly to how we specified images for the background of an element,
          we can specify an image to serve as the basis for decorative borders.</p>
          
          <p>Visit this simple <a href="css3_examples/ex3.html">example page</a>
          to see how such borders look like. The basis image for all of them is 
          shown here:</p>
          <figure class="text-center">
              <img src="css3_examples/images/smallstar.png" alt="small star"
                   class="img-thumbnail">
          </figure>
          <p>The syntax for the <code>border-image</code> is shown below:</p>
           <pre>
selector { border-image: <em>source slice repeat</em>; }
<strong>Example:</strong>
#frame1 { border-image: url("images/smallstar.png") 25 25 stretch; }
</pre> 
        
          <p>In addition to providing the <code>border-image</code>, it's important
          to specify a <code>border-width</code> as well (see the frames in the example
          above). Here is an explanation for the different values used in the rule:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>The value <em>source</em> is the URL to the location of the image.</li>
            <li>The value <em>slice</em> is a length or percentage value (or series of values,
              specified in the order:  top, right, bottom, left) 
              that sets a distance from each edge of the image marking the area that will be 
              used to <q>frame</q> the element.</li>
            <li>The <em>repeat</em> value takes either one or two keywords, which set the way the image 
              is repeated along the top and bottom (first keyword) and left and right (second 
              keyword) of the element. The possible values are <em>stretch</em>, which stretches the 
              image to fill the border length; <em>repeat</em>, which tiles the image across the length; 
              <em>round</em>, which tiles the image across the length using a whole number of tiles 
              (the element will be resized to accommodate this); and <em>space</em>, which also tiles 
              the image across the length using a whole number of tiles, but using spaces if 
              the image doesn’t fit the element.</li>
          </ul>
        
          <p>The most difficult value to understant is slice. First, there are two kinds of values
          it takes: pixels (but without using the "px" prefix) and percentages (using the % symbol).
            Then, the numbers are used to slice from the image portions of it from the top, right,
            bottom and left. When only one value is specified, the same portion is sliced from all
            sides. If two values are specified, the first is used for top and bottom and the other
            for right and left, and so on. Below is an example of how the value <code>25 25</code>
            generates four slices from our original image.
          </p>
          <figure class="text-center">
            <img src="images/top.png" alt="top slice" style="margin-right: 20px">
            <img src="images/right.png" alt="right slice" style="margin-right: 20px">
            <img src="images/bottom.png" alt="bottom slice" style="margin-right: 20px">
            <img src="images/left.png" alt="left slice" style="margin-right: 20px">
            <figcaption>Slices of the original image along four sides: top, right, bottom, left.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          
          <p>Then, each of these slices will be used in the corresponding border side, to generate
          the frame, according to the repeat rule. Refer again to the CSS rules used
          in our <a href="css3_examples/ex3.html">example page</a> to see the effect of 
            <em>stretch</em>, <em>round</em>, and <em>repeat</em>.

        <h3>Box Shadow</h3>
          <p>Box shadow is very similar to text shadow that we discussed previously 
          in these notes. Its role is to add shadows to box elements. 
            This is the syntax for this property:</p>
          
          <pre>
selector { box-shadow: <em>inset x y blur spread color</em>; }
</pre>
          
          <p>The first value, <em>inset</em> is an optional keyword that sets whether 
            the shadow sits inside or outside of the element. 
            If inset is not specified, the shadow will sit outside. The next
            three values (x, y, blur) are the same as for the text-shadow.
            <em>spread</em> sets the distance the shadow spreads. A positive length 
            makes the shadow larger than its element, and viceversa.</p>
            <p>Here is a small div with a box shadow:</p>
          
            <div id="shadowBox" style="margin: 25px auto;"></div>
          
         <p>The effect was created with this CSS rule:</p> 
    <pre>
#shadowBox {
        background-color: #8942D6;
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
        box-shadow: 10px 10px 20px 10px #5A0DAC;
      }
</pre>     
          <p>W3Schools has a very <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/playit.asp?filename=playcss_box-shadow">
            good interactive example</a> for exploring different
            combinations of values for this property.</p>
          
        <h2 id="more">Even more CSS3 features</h2>
        <p>There is more to CSS3 that we are able to cover in these notes. We will
          discuss the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp">gradient</a>
          property when we talk about colors. Here are some other features that you
          are encouraged to explore on your own.</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><em>Multi-columns</em> This property replaces to some extent <em>float</em>
            for creating multi-columns when you have large amount of text. It is especially
            useful for newspapers and magazines. There are several features related to this concept:
            <code>column-count</code>, <code>column-width</code>, <code>column-gap</code>,
            <code>column-rule</code>. </li>
            <li><em>2D Transformations</em> Such transformation allow the designer to 
            rotate, resize, and skew elements. All these transformations are realized
            through one feature: <code>transform</code>, which has this syntax:</li>
            <pre>
selector { transform: <em>function(value); }</em>
</pre>
          Different <em>functions</em> will then apply the desired effect. Here is 
            a list of some of the functions:
            <ul>
              <li><em>rotate(value)</em> The vaue represent the angle of rotation, e.g. 25deg, -90deg, etc.
              It is possible to use the property <code>transform-origin</code> to change the origin of 
              the point that serves as center of the rotation. The default origin for rotation is the
              center of the element.</li>
              <li><em>translate(x,y), translateX(value), translateY(value)</em> These functions move
              an element either along both axes (the first one), or along one specified axis. </li>
            </ul>
            <li><em>Transitions and Animations</em> Advanced properties, that try to mimic some of the things
            that are realized with Javascript.</li>
            <li><em>3D-Transformations </em> This uses all of the 2d-Transformation functions, but now
            in three dimensions. Only <code>-webkit-</code> browsers have implemented this feature.</li>
            <li><em>Flexible Box Layout</em> This is one of the most recent additions that allows to
            perform layout without the need for <code>float</code>. Every browser has its own
            implementation that needs to be accessed through a prefix.</li>
          </ul>
