        <p>Building upon the idea of <a
        href="../compModel/information.html">representation</a>, we will
        discuss how images are represented in digital form.  We'll work up to
        it, first starting with how color is represented (which is based on
          the physiology of the human eye), then looking at <a href="images.html">images</a> as
        rectangular arrangements of spots of pure color.  Finally, we'll
        calculate the file size of an image and discuss one way of
        <em>compressing</em> the file so that it is smaller and therefore
        faster to download.  This compression is, in fact, a different
        <em>representation</em> of the information.
        <!--We'll also briefly
mention two other representations, but we won't spend time in class
discussing those formats.  You can read that on your own.-->
 
          <h2 id="standard">Standard Colors</h2>
          In the present day, modern browsers support 140 color names. This means
          that we can use color names such as <code>black</code>, <code>aqua</code>,
          or <code>chocolate</code> as values for the CSS properties that except 
          a color value, such as <code>color</code>, <code>background-color</code>, etc.
          Many years ago, browsers could only support 17 color names, known as standard
          colors: <em>aqua, black, blue, fuchsia, gray, green, lime, maroon, navy, olive, 
          orange, purple, red, silver, teal, white, and yellow</em>. However, later that
          list was expanded with 123 more colors. W3Schools maintains
          a complete list of the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colornames.asp">
          140 recognized color names</a>. While you can achieve a lot by using 
          only these named colors, very often you want something more specific from the color
          spectrum. It turns out, we can use numerical codes to refer to colors, because 
          inside the computer, colors are represented by numbers, in the same
          way as text characters (ASCII and unicode). How? For that, we need to understand 
          additive colors and color vision.
          
          <H2 id="vision">Additive (RGB) Colors and Color Vision</H2>
          
          <P>Our retinas happen to have rod-shaped cells that are sensitive to
all light, and cone-shaped cells that come in three kinds:
red-sensitive, green-sensitive, and blue-sensitive. Therefore, there
are three (additive) primary colors: Red, Green and Blue or RGB. All
visible colors are seen by exciting these three types of cells in
various degrees. (For more information, consult these Wikipedia articles
on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_color">additive color</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_vision">color
vision</a>.)

<P>Color monitors and TV sets use RGB to display all their colors,
including yellow, chartreuse, you name it. So, every color is some amount
of Red, some amount of Green, and some amount of Blue. 

<P>On computers, RGB color components are standardly defined on a scale from 0 to 255, 
which is 8 bits or 1 byte.

  <p>We can use this knowledge about colors being represented as a mix
          of red, blue, and green when specifying color values in CSS.
          There are three ways to do this:</p>  
          
          <pre>
color: rgb(64,224,208);   /* three RGB numbers in the range 0-255 */
color: rgb(25%,88%,82%);  /* three RGB percentages */
color: #40E0D0;           /* three RGB numbers expressed as a hexadecimal triple */
</pre>
          
 <p>The first two ways are self-explanatory, since they use decimal numbers
          and percentage values with which you are familiar. In the following,
          we will explain the meaning of the hexadecimal color codes such as
          <code>#40E0D0</code>. The <code>#</code> sign is used in this case
          to simply indicate that the sequence of digits and letters that is
          following it should be represented as a hexadecimal code.</p>   
          
    <H2 id="hexadecimal">Hexadecimal</H2>
         
<P>People use decimal (base 10), computers use binary (base 2), but
programmers often use <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> (base
16) for convenience.
         
<P>Binary numerals get long very fast. It is not easy to remember 24
binary digits, but you can more easily remember 6 hexadecimal
digits. Each hexadecimal digit represents exactly four binary digits
(bits).  (This is because 2<sup>4</sup>=16.)

<p>One way to understand hexadecimal is by analogy with decimal, but
we're all so familiar with decimal numerals that our reflexes get in
the way.  (In fact, humans throughout history have used many different
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system">numeral
systems</a>; decimal is not sacrosanct.)  So, we first need to break
down decimal notation so that you can see the analogy with
hexadecimal.  For now, we'll stick with two-digit numerals, but the
same ideas extend to any larger numbers.

<P>Decimal notation works by organizing things into groups of ten,
then counting the groups and the leftovers: Suppose you had a bunch of
sticks on the ground and you bundled them all into groups of 10 with
some left over (fewer than 10). Now, use a symbol to denote the number
of bundles and another symbol to denote the number of sticks left
over. You've just invented two-digit numbers in base 10.
         
<P>Hexadecimal: Do the same thing with bundles of 16, and you've invented
two-digit numbers in base 16.  For example, if you had thirty-five sticks
<!--(I'm trying to avoid decimal notation)-->, they could be bundled into two
groups of sixteen and three left over, so the hexadecimal notation is 23.
Careful!  That numeral isn't the decimal number twenty-three!  It's still
thirty-five sticks, but we write it down in hexadecimal as 23.

<p>To distinguish a decimal numeral from a hexadecimal numeral, we use
subscripts.  So, to say that thirty-five sticks is written 23 in
hexadecimal, we can write:

<blockquote><p>35<sub>10</sub> = 23<sub>16</sub></blockquote>

<p>Both decimal and hexadecimal notations are based on <!--em>place
value</em--> <em>position</em>.  We say that 23<sub>16</sub> means 35<sub>10</sub> because
it's a "2" in the <em>sixteens</em> position and "3" in the <em>ones</em>
position, just like 35<sub>10</sub> has a "3" in the <em>tens</em> position
and a "5" in the <em>ones</em> position.

<p>Let's take another example.  Suppose we have 26<sub>10</sub>
sticks.  That's one group of 16 and 10 left over.  How do we write
that number in hexadecimal?  Is it 110<sub>16</sub>?  That is, a "1"
in the <em>sixteens</em> place followed by a "10" in the <em>ones</em>
place? No; that would be confusing, since it would look like a
three-digit numeral.  We need a symbol that means ten. We can't use
"10," since that's not a single symbol.  Instead, we use "A"; that is,
A<sub>16</sub>=10<sub>10</sub>.  Similarly, "B" means 11, "C" means
12, "D" means 13, "E" means 14, and "F" means 15.  We don't need any
more symbols, because we can't have 16 things left over, since that
would make another group of 16.  The following table summarizes these
correspondences and what we've done so far.

<h2 id="binary_conversion">Converting Hexadecimal to or from Binary</h2>

<p>Now that we know both hexadecimal and binary, you can convert binary to
  hexadecimal (and vice versa).  However, you would probably do so by
  converting the binary number to decimal and then the decimal number to
  hexadecimal.  There's a better way, involving almost no arithmetic (or,
  rather, all the arithmetic is with one-digit numbers you can add in your
  head).  Indeed, this technique is the <em>reason</em> that computer
  scientists like using hexadecimal. <!-- (Well, this and getting to spell
  words like ACE and DEADBEEF with hex digits.)-->

<h3>Example 1</h3>

<p>Let's start with an example.  Suppose you need to convert the following
  from binary to hexadecimal:

  <blockquote><p>01010100 = ??<sub>16</sub></blockquote>

<p>What we're going to do is to take the bits in chunks of four bits, so
  to mark the chunks we'll insert a period in the middle of the number:

  <blockquote><p>0101.0100 = ??<sub>16</sub></blockquote>

<p>Now, we just convert each chunk directly into hex.  The first chunk,
  0101, is just the number 5. The second chunk, 0100, is just the number
  4.  Those are already in hex, so we are done:

  <blockquote><p>0101.0100 = 54<sub>16</sub></blockquote>

<p>(Try doing it via decimal, to check.  The decimal value corresponding
  to both of these is 80+4=84.)

<h3>Example 2</h3>

<p>Let's do another one, this time with slightly larger values:

  <blockquote><p>10101100 = ??<sub>16</sub></blockquote>

<p>Again, take the bits in chunks of four bits:

  <blockquote><p>1010.1100 = ??<sub>16</sub></blockquote>

<p>Now, we just convert each chunk directly into hex.  The first chunk,
  1010, is 8+2 or 10<sub>10</sub>, which is the digit A in hex. The second
  chunk, 1100, is 8+4 or 12<sub>10</sub>, which is the digit C in hex. So
  we are now done:

  <blockquote><p>1010.1100 = AC<sub>16</sub></blockquote>

<p>(Again, check our work by doing it via decimal.  The decimal value
  corresponding to both of these is 160+12=172.)

<h3>Explanation</h3>

<p>Why does this work?  Suppose we needed to convert 172 from decimal to
  hex: our first step would be to divide the number by 16.  In binary,
  moving the <q>binary point</q> to the left by one place is equivalent to
  dividing by two, so moving the binary point four places is equivalent to
  dividing by 16.  So when we put a period in the middle of the 8-bit
  binary number, it is exactly the same as dividing by 16.  We then have
  the quotient to the left of the binary point, and the remainder to the
  right of the binary point.  Just convert each to hex, and we are done.

<p>Notice that the only arithmetic we have to do is converting each chunk
  of four bits to the equivalent hex digit.  The mental arithmetic
  involved is limited: we know that (1) we are adding one-digit numbers,
  (2) at most four of them, and (3) the sum will always be less than 16.

< 
<h3>Example 3</h3>

<p>This technique works in reverse, too.  Let's convert DEADBEEF from
  hexadecimal to binary:
  
  <blockquote><p>???????? = DEADBEEF<sub>16</sub></blockquote>

<p>becomes

  <blockquote><p>1101.1110.1010.1101.1011.1110.1110.1111  = DEADBEEF<sub>16</sub></blockquote>

<h3>Shortcuts</h3>

<p>Now, to be honest, it may seem ridiculous to convert a large hex digit
like D to binary in your head.  First, you don't have to do it in your
  head; a few quick calculations on paper will suffice.  Second, if you
  can manage to remember (memorize) just three values, you can get the
  rest by mental arithmetic.  Remember:
  <blockquote><p>A = 10<sub>10</sub> = 8+2 = 1010<br>
      C = 12<sub>10</sub> = 8+4 = 1100<br>
      F = 15<sub>10</sub> = 8+4+2+1 = 1111<br>
</blockquote>

<p>F is the easiest to remember, because it's the <em>largest</em>
  four-bit number, so <em>all</em> the bits have to be one.  So, F is just
  1111, with no arithmetic at all.

<p>Then, if we have to convert B, just remember that B is one more than A,
  so write down the bits for A (1010), but add one and write down 1011.

<p>If we have to convert D, just remember that D is one more than C, and
  so we write down 1101.

<p>If we have to convert E, just remember that E is one less than F, and
  so we write down 1110.-->
  
  <h2 id="colors_in_hex">Colors using Hexadecimal</h2>

<p>We already know that every color in a computer is a combination
of some amount of each of the three primary colors: red, green and blue.
The amounts are <em>always</em> given in the same order: red, green,
blue.  The amounts are numbers from 0 to 255<sub>10</sub>, or, in
hexadecimal, 00 to FF<sub>16</sub>.  Each primary is expressed as a
two-digit numeral in hexadecimal, using a leading zero if necessary so
that the numeral is always two digits.  Three pairs of hexadecimal
digits completely specifies a color.  Finally, the notation for a
color always starts with a pound sign (#).  For example, a color like
(35, 230, 10) would be written #23E60A. 

<P>Now you can construct the colors <a href="#vision">above</a> (gold,
cornflower and DodgerBlue). 
  
<!--Furthermore, you can understand the
middle column of the table at the top.  Let's go back to that table
and observe the following:

<ul>

    <li>Look at the first four rows: When all three primary colors are
    equal, the result is a shade of gray.

    <li>The larger the numbers, the brighter the color:
    <code>FF</code> is greater than <code>80</code>

    <li>Notice that each bright color is preceded by a darker version of
    the same color, substituting <code>80</code> for <code>FF</code>,
    which is roughly half the brightness of that primary.  For example,
    red (<code>#FF0000</code>) is preceded by maroon
    (<code>#800000</code>).
    
    <li>Looking just at the bright colors (every other color after
    skipping the first four), we go around the rim of the color wheel:
    <ul class="compact">
    <li>red
    <li>yellow (=red+green)
    <li>green
    <li>aqua (=green+blue)
    <li>blue
    <li>fuchsia (=blue+red)
    </ul>
