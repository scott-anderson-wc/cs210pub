# Environment, HTML and URLs

This is our first class, so we'll talk about the course, and then get
started setting up our environment and getting under way.

## About this Course

The history is told on the [home page][../../index.html]. In a nutshell:

    * Like CS 110 (HTML, CSS, JS, JQ), but for those who know some programming
    * Prereqs are *either* CS 111 *or* CS 115
    * I expect that you know programming basics:
        * variables and scope
        * conditionals
        * loops
        * functions
        * methods
        * arrays and dictionaries (Python) or arrays and objects (JavaScript)
    * I do *not* expect that you know much HTML or CSS. It always helps if you do, of course.
    * The plan is for this course to be renumbered CS 210 and be offered every year, maybe more.
    
## Target Audience

Intended to be a class for *beginners* in either CS or MAS, with just one prior course.

Similar to CS 230 rather than CS 304.

However, this semester, due to its newness and the fact that seniors get
first dibs, that isn't really the case.

So, one difficulty is the range of skill and experience in the class.

## About the Course

Web Applications have a front-end and a back-end. The front-end is
everything that happens in the browser.  In general, sticking just to the
front-end is not much of a limitation. Many powerful applications are
*mostly* front-end, except for long-term storage of data:
    * FaceBook
    * Gmail
    * Google Docs

We will learn:
    * HTML
    * CSS
    * JavaScript
    * the DOM, which is how JavaScript controls the page, including HTML, CSS and event handling
