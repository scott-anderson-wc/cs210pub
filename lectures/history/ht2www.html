					<p>As incredible as it may seem, the web is a relatively recent
development in the life of computing. Up until the early 1990's, very
few people would foresee the amazing explosion that computing
experienced with the development of the web, the online libraries,
e-Commerce, the dot-com boom (and plop).  Computers used to be
isolated, and email was the most common way to communicate with
others.  We will examine here briefly how all this changed.

<H2 id="hypertext">Hypertext</H2>

<P><STRONG>Hypertext </STRONG> refers to the familiar action of clicking
on a word (or chunk of text) to take you to another page. As a term, it
was coined by Ted Nelson in <EM>Literary Machines</EM> in 1965:

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
<p>By <A HREF="http://www.artmuseum.net/w2vr/timeline/Nelson.html">
hypertext </A> I mean non-sequential writing &mdash; text that branches and
allows choice to the reader, best read at an interactive screen. As
popularly conceived, this is a series of text chunks connected by
links which offer the reader different pathways.
</div>

<p>Note the comment on interactive screens.  In 1965 most computers did
not have a monitor as we know it today.  People were communicating
with computers through paper-based, typewriter-like devices on which
both the human and the computer would write (when they weren't using
punched cards).  In fact, the mouse had not been invented yet. It was
invented a couple years later by Doug Engelbart who also gave a
demonstration of one of the first hypertext system, NLS.  NLS (for <A
HREF="http://www.artmuseum.net/w2vr/timeline/Engelbart.html">oN-Line
System</A>, though it was not what we call today &ldquo;on-line&rdquo;
&mdash; there was no &ldquo;line&rdquo; to start with) contained
100,000 papers and cross references.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="vanevar_bush.gif" ALT="Vanevar Bush" style="float: left; margin-right: 5px"> The
idea of hypertext, however, is much older than the term. In his seminal
article entitled "As we may think", published in the July, 1945, issue of
the Atlantic Monthly, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanevar_Bush">Vanevar Bush</a>, 
	the science advisor to President
Roosevelt descibes a system for "Memory Extension".  Take a look at the
way he describes <STRONG>memex</STRONG>, a deceptively desk-looking piece
of furniture:</P>
<br>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
  <p>Consider a future device for individual use, which is a sort of
 mechanized private file and library. It needs a name, and to coin one at
 random, "memex" will do. A memex is a device in which an individual
 stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is
 mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and
 flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.

 <p>It consists of a desk, and while it can presumably be operated from a
distance, it is primarily the piece of furniture at which he works. On the
top are slanting translucent screens, on which material can be projected
for convenient reading. There is a keyboard, and sets of buttons and
levers. Otherwise it looks like an ordinary desk.

</div>

<p><IMG SRC="memex.jpg" ALT="The Memex Device"  WIDTH=300
     style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"> 

<P>Memex was never built, but the ideas introduced by Bush were
remembered, or re-invented, a couple dozen years later. And in 1978,
extending the idea of hypertext, the first <strong>hypermedia</strong>
document was created. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspen_Movie_Map">
	Aspen Movie Map</a> allowed the viewer to visit
Aspen, Colorado, by turning any town corner they wanted independently of
the sequence of filming.  Memex was supposed to be customized and would
help the user in 'his library':

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
<p>Any given book of his library can thus be called up and consulted with far
greater facility than if it were taken from a shelf. As he has several
projection positions, he can leave one item in position while he calls up
another. He can add marginal notes and comments, taking advantage of one
possible type of dry photography, and it could even be arranged so that he
can do this by a stylus scheme, such as is now employed in the
telautograph seen in railroad waiting rooms, just as though he had the
physical page before him.
</p></div>

<p>Note that Bush is trying to descibe his invention in terms of the
technology of the time, microfiche and dry photograhy. And he is probably
overly optimistic of this technology, too:

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
	<p>All this is conventional, except for the projection forward
of present-day mechanisms and gadgetry. It affords an immediate step,
however, to associative indexing, the basic idea of which is a provision
whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and
automatically another. This is the essential feature of the memex. The
process of tying two items together is the important thing.  </p>
	</div>

<p><STRONG>Associative indexing</STRONG>... What is he talking about? Do you
recognize the concept of hyperlink behind the term he invents? Further
down he introduces the concept of a search engine, and describes it with
an example:
<br>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
<p>
 The owner of the memex, let us say, is interested in the origin and
 properties of the bow and arrow. Specifically he is studying why the
 short Turkish bow was apparently superior to the English long bow in the
 skirmishes of the Crusades. He has dozens of possibly pertinent books and
 articles in his memex. First he runs through an encyclopedia, finds an
 interesting but sketchy article, leaves it projected. Next, in a history,
 he finds another pertinent item, and ties the two together. Thus he goes,
 building a trail of many items. Occasionally he inserts a comment of his
 own, either linking it into the main trail or joining it by a side trail
 to a particular item. When it becomes evident that the elastic properties
 of available materials had a great deal to do with the bow, he branches
 off on a side trail which takes him through textbooks on elasticity and
 tables of physical constants. He inserts a page of longhand analysis of
 his own. Thus he builds a trail of his interest through the maze of
 materials available to him.

</p></div>

<p>Why does he come up with the idea of associative indexing? The
inspiration comes from the troubles that people always had with indexing:</p>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
<p>Our ineptitude in getting at the record is largely caused by the
artificiality of systems of indexing. When data of any sort are placed in
storage, they are filed alphabetically or numerically, and information is
found (when it is) by tracing it down from subclass to subclass. It can be
in only one place, unless duplicates are used; one has to have rules as to
which path will locate it, and the rules are cumbersome. Having found one
item, moreover, one has to emerge from the system and re-enter on a new
path.

<p>The human mind does not work that way. It operates by association. With
one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by
the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of
trails carried by the cells of the brain. It has other characteristics, of
course; trails that are not frequently followed are prone to fade, items
are not fully permanent, memory is transitory. Yet the speed of action,
the intricacy of trails, the detail of mental pictures, is awe-inspiring
beyond all else in nature.

<p>Man cannot hope fully to duplicate this mental process artificially, but
he certainly ought to be able to learn from it. In minor ways he may even
improve, for his records have relative permanency. The first idea,
however, to be drawn from the analogy concerns selection [He means
selecting relevant items among many]. Selection by association, rather
than by indexing, may yet be mechanized. One cannot hope thus to equal the
speed and flexibility with which the mind follows an associative trail,
but it should be possible to beat the mind decisively in regard to the
permanence and clarity of the items resurrected from storage.

<H2 id="www">The World Wide Web</H2>

<p>The late '60s and early '70s saw an amazing amount of innovation in
Computer Science. The first hypertext system was implemented in 1967 (at
Brown University by Andy van Dam), the mouse was invented the next year
(at Stanford by <A
HREF="http://www.artmuseum.net/w2vr/archives/Engelbart/Engelbart.html">
Doug Engelbart</A>) enabling the development of WYSIWYG applications, the
<A HREF="http://www.artmuseum.net/w2vr/timeline/Kay.html"> windows GUI
environment </A> was implemented in 1972 (on XEROX's Alto computer by <A
HREF="http://www.artmuseum.net/w2vr/archives/Kay/Kay.html">Alan Kay</A>),
the internet was born (around 1972), and protocols of allowing computers
to exchange information (the TCP/IP protocol in 1978) were also
developed. Even the idea of linking all documents on earth was under way,
due to Ted Nelson's <STRONG>XANADU</STRONG> project.

<P>All the components of the web were in place by the late 1970's. The
only thing one would have to do is put these pieces together and allow
users to create their own documents and link them on the internet. Yet, it
would take more than 10 years for the web to be born. Why might that have
been the case?

<P><IMG SRC="tim_berners-lee.gif" ALT="Tim Berners-Lee" style="float:
right"> Tim Berners-Lee, programmer at CERN (Centre European pour la
Recherche Nucleaire -or- European Laboratory for Particle Physics) was
trying to help physicists exchange their papers and was frustrated by the
cumbersome process it involved. It was possible for a physicist to post
and retrieve papers from a few servers, but it would take a couple of
minutes and a few unreadable lines of code to do that. Geeks were happy
(even proud) with this process, but the CERN scientists were not.

<P>After an initial attempt at the problem, when he developed the
'Enquire' system, he submitted a proposal to CERN entitled simply
<EM>Information Management: A Proposal </EM>. In this, he describes "a
simple scheme to incorporate several different servers of machine-stored
information already available at CERN." It has been reported that the
proposal's main objectives were:

<UL>
        <LI> the provision of <STRONG> a simple protocol </STRONG> for requesting human readable information stored in remote systems accessible using networks.
        <LI> to provide a protocol by which information could automatically be exchanged in a format common to the information supplier and the information consumer 
        <LI> the provision of some method of reading text (and possibly graphics) using a large proportion of the display technology in use at CERN at that time
        <LI> the provision and maintenance of <STRONG> collections of documents, </STRONG>  into which users could place documents of their own.
        <LI> to allow documents or collections of documents managed by individuals <STRONG> to be linked by hyperlinks </STRONG> to other documents or collections of documents.
        <LI> the provision of <STRONG> a search option, </STRONG> to allow information to be automatically searched for by keywords,
in addition to being navigated to by the following of hyperlinks
        <LI> to use <STRONG> public domain software </STRONG> wherever possible and to interface to existing proprietary systems.
        <LI> to provide the necessary software <STRONG> free of charge</STRONG>.
</UL>

<P>The first three provisions resulted in the development of the first
hypertext protocol, HTTP, which appears on the top of your browser. The
first browser, Mosaic, was released in 1990 and the WWW was born.

<P>Note that in Tim Berners-Lee's vision, the system is not controlled by
a superior entity, it is extendible, and free. All of these reasons made
it quickly acceptable and successful. There are many interesting lessons
to be learned by the history of the development of the web. Note that
Berners-Lee did not made huge amounts of money out of his contribution,
though many made out of his.

CERN.

<H2 id="web2">Web 2.0 </H2>

<p>The term Web 2.0 was invented in 2004 by O'Reilly media (a technical
publishing company) and CMP media (a multi-media company) at a
&quot;brainstorming session&quot;. Since then, O'Reilly media has
organized a series of conferences about Web 2.0 and the term is becoming
widely adopted.

<p>In 2005 Tim O'Reilly published
a <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html">paper
which defines Web 2.0</a>. Web 2.0 is not a new version of the web. The
term generally refers to using the web as a &quot;platform&quot; and
encompasses services that enable communities, collaboration and sharing
among users. For instance, O'Reilly cites Google, Napster, Wikipedia,
blogging and social networking sites as examples of Web 2.0 features.

<P>Many people have questioned whether the term is actually meaningful
because many of the features of Web 2.0 have been present since the origin
of the World Wide Web.  <!--Web 2.0 is a relatively new concept and its
meaning continues to be understood as it grows in use.-->
