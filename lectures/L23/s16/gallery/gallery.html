  <h1>Image Gallery</h1>

  <p>Often, you want to display a set of pictures and allow the user to
  choose which ones to look at more closely, something like an art
  gallery. Therefore, we'll call this JavaScript application
  a <em>gallery</em>. We'll have an arrangement of small pictures, often
  called <em>thumbnails</em>, and, if the user clicks on any one of them,
  a larger version is displayed.

  <p>Note that one advantage of a gallery is that a set of thumbnails can
  load quicker than even one of the larger versions, if the file-sizes are
  much smaller. Therefore, you should go to the extra effort to make
  thumbnail-size images, using an image editor (like PhotoShop
  or <a href="http://pixlr.com">Pixlr</a> or
  the <a href="http://gimp.org">Gimp</a>), rathern than just using the
  width and height attributes to make the squeeze the big files down to a
  small screen area.

    <h2 id="gallery-example">Gallery Example</h2>
    
  <p>This will just be a small gallery, with just four pictures. In this
  version of the gallery application, we'll allocate space on the page for
  the larger version. In this example, we'll put a boring pale-yellow
  image there. In your application, you could choose one of the large
  images, either randomly or deterministically, or something else
  entirely.
    
    <div id="gallery1"></div>

    <figure id="large_image">
      <img src="../potterpics/pale-yellow-266x200.png" alt="filler image">
      <figcaption>A pale yellow image filler image</figcaption>
    </figure>
      
    <h2 id="lightbox-gallery">Lightbox Gallery</h2>

    <p>An alternative is to have the large image take over the window,
    putting everything else behind a semi-transparent dim filter, so that
    the user's attention is necessarily on the large image. This is called
    a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightbox_(JavaScript)">Lightbox</a>,
    and has been implemented many times since its originator, Lokesh
    Dhakar. We've implemented a very simple version of it; there are many
    more sophisticated ones. The lightbox, of course, requires an
    additional bit of coding to make the image go away so that the user can
    look at another image or do anything else.

    <div id="lightbox_gallery"></div>

    <div id="lightbox_display">
      <div id="lightbox_inner">
        <figure>
          <img src="../potterpics/pale-yellow-266x200.png" alt="filler image">
          <figcaption>A pale yellow image filler image</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
    </div>
