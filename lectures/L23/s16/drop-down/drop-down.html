  <h1>Drop-Down Menus</h1>

  <p>When a webpage has more links than the designer wants to make
  visible, a common approach is to use a <em>drop-down menu</em>. You'll
  see an example at the top of this page, but I'm sure you're already
  familiar with them. While there are many ways to create drop-down menus,
  we will just discuss one of them.

  <p>Unlike many drop-down menus, however, we are going to require the
  user to click on the menu in order to reveal the hidden links. This is
  because the action of <q>hovering over</q> a menu item, which works fine
  with computer mice, doesn't work so well with touch-screen devices. By
  using only the <em>click</em> event, our approach will work for both
  mice and fingertips.
    
    <h2>Drop-down in Action</h2>

    <p>Here's a link to a page with the
     <a href="scott-v2.html">final drop-down menu</a> that we will build.
     It is fully functional, mobile-friendly, and the CSS is
     comprehensible.

    <p>Use <q>view source</q> on that page to see exactly how we did it.

     <h2>Concepts</h2>

     <ul>
       <li>Mobile devices often have narrow displays. By keeping the text
       short ("News" not "Current Events" and "CS110" not "Computers and
       the Internet"), we facilitate that. Try making the window very
       narrow. Each top-level menu item is only 65px wide (total width
       including margins and padding is 85px). So the whole thing is just
       4*85=340px wide.  The widths are explicitly defined, so that every
       top-level menu item is the same width.

       <li>We use <code>display: inline-block</code> for the top-level
       menu items (LI). This is similar to floating, in that the LI
       elements are laid out horizontally, but we don't have trouble with
       non-floated stuff coming up next to them and they contribute to the
       height and widths of their parent. See
         <ul>
           <li><a href="http://robertnyman.com/2010/02/24/css-display-inline-block-why-it-rocks-and-why-it-sucks/">CSS
           display inline block: Why it Rocks, and Why it Sucks</a>
           <li><a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/css/css2/display.html#inlineBlock">QuirksMode
           Display property</a>
         </ul>

       <li>We add a click handler on the upper-level menu items that have
         sub-menus to open/close the sub-menus. We mark the menus with a
         class, <code>has_submenu</code>; we can use that class with
         jQuery to add the click handlers.

       <li>We use <code>$(this)</code> to get the element that was clicked
       on.

       <li>We use the JQ <code>.find()</code> method to find descendants of
         the clicked element.
         
       <li>We add a click handler to the document so that if you click
       anywhere else (not on a menu or submenu) it closes any open
       sub-menus.
         
       <li>We
         use <a href="https://api.jquery.com/event.stoppropagation/"><code>event.StopPropagation()</code></a>
         to keep a click on a top-level menu from bubbling up to the
         document and causing the sub-menu to be closed.

     </ul>

    <h2>Drop-down Development</h2>

    <p>Let's start with a set of menus without any CSS or JS at all:

      <nav id="nav_1">
        <!--#include virtual="menu.part"-->
      </nav>

    <p>Now, let's add the CSS to make them look pretty. You're welcome to
    look at the CSS, but we basically just use simple stuff like color,
    margin, padding, width, text-decoration:none, list-style-type:none,
    text-align and border. The more complex CSS is:
      <ul>
        <li>We use <code>position:relative</code> on the top-level menu
        items, so that the sub-menus are positioned relative to the
        top-level item they belong to
          
        <li>We use <code>position:absolute</code> to position the
        sub-menus relative to their parents.
          
      </ul>

      <p>For purposes of exposition, we omitted
      the <code>display:none</code> on the sub-menus and made the parents
      wider so that all the sub-menus could be displayed without
      overlapping.

      <style>
        #nav_2 ul ul { display: block !important; }
        #nav_2 > ul > li { width: 231px !important; }
      </style>

      <nav class="mynav" id="nav_2">
        <!--#include virtual="menu.part"-->
      </nav>        

      <p style="margin-top:6em">Now, we'll add a simple click-handler that just toggles the
      sub-menu. We'll add it by code like this:
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
function toggleSubmenu_v1() {
    $(this).find("ul").toggle();
}

$(".has_submenu").click(toggleSubmenu_v1);
</pre>

      <style>
        #nav_3 > ul > li { width: 231px !important; }
      </style>


      <nav class="mynav" id="nav_3">
        <!--#include virtual="menu.part"-->
      </nav>        



      <p>You could use this kind of interface, but it's not what people
      expect, because it's possible to open several menus at once. (Try
      it!)  Usually, if you click on a heading, say "News", to open it,
      and then you on another heading, say "CS110", you expect the "News"
      submenu to close. We'll achieve this by adding a click handler to
      the <em>document</em> that closes all the submenus. Like this:

        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
function closeAll() {
    $(".has_submenu ul").hide();
}

$(document).click(closeAll);
</pre>

      <p>However, that has a hidden trap, which is that if we click on
      "News," that <em>also</em> counts as a click on the document. That
      is, the <em>click</em> event <q>bubbles</q> up the document from
      child to parent until it reaches the very top (which is
      the <code>document</code> selector we saw above). What we want to do
      is stop the bubbling or <em>propagation</em> of this event.

      <p>To do that, we add an argument to the click handler for top-level
      menu items. The argument is typically called something
      like <code>event</code> or <code>evt</code>.  That argument will be
      given a value by the browser when it invokes the click handler. The
      value is an <em>object</em> that includes a lot of information about
      the event. The event object also has a <em>method</em>
      called <code>stopPropagation</code>, which is exactly the tool we
      need. So here's our new code:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
function toggleSubmenu_v2(event) {
    event.stopPropagation();
    $(this).find("ul").toggle();
}

$(".has_submenu").click(toggleSubmenu_v2);
</pre>

      <p>Here's the new menu:

        <nav id="nav_4" class="mynav">
          <!--#include virtual="menu.part"-->
        </nav>


      <h2>Credit</h2>

      <p>We were inspired by this which we based on this wonderfully
  written tutorial by <q>Iggy</q> on
  a <a href="http://line25.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pure-css-dropdown-menu">how
  to create a pure CSS Drop-down Menu</a>. Unfortunately, that tutorial
  uses :hover, which is great of desktop applications where a mouse can
  hover over a menu item to reveal a submenu, but that doesn't work with
  touch-screen applications, as most mobile devices are.  Since we want to
  write pages that are usable with touch-screens, we ultimately had to
  abandon Iggy's approach. Still, hat's off to it.

  <!-- Placed at the end of the document so the pages load faster -->
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"></script>
  <script>
    function toggleSubmenu_v1() {
        $(this).find("ul").toggle();
    }

    /* This works fine with single-levels of menus, but if there are
    sub-sub-menus, the upper menu will close when you try to open a
    sub-sub-menu, which is obviously not what you want. More elaborate
    programming would be necessary. */

    $("#nav_3 .has_submenu").click(toggleSubmenu_v1);

    function toggleSubmenu() {
        console.log("clicked on top-level menu item");
        that = this;
        ul = $(this).find("ul");
        var state = ul.css("display");
        console.log("before, state is "+state);
        ul.toggle();
        state = ul.css("display");
        console.log("state is now "+state);
    }

    // $("#nav_3 .has_submenu").click(toggleSubmenu);


// ================================================================

function closeAll() {
    $(".has_submenu ul").hide();
}

$(document).click(closeAll);

function toggleSubmenu_v2(event) {
    event.stopPropagation();
    $(this).find("ul").toggle();
}

$("#nav_4 .has_submenu").click(toggleSubmenu_v2);
