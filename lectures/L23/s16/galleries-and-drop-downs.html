<h2>Drop-Downs</h2>

<p>Here's a link to a page with the
     <a href="drop-down/scott-v2.html">final drop-down menu</a> that we will build.
     It is fully functional, mobile-friendly, and the CSS is
     comprehensible.

<p>We now turn to drop-down menus, which will use many of these same
  ideas:
  <ul>
    
    <li>The <code>this</code> variable
    <li>Things that appear and disappear when clicked on, or
    <li>make <em>other</em> elements appear and disappear.
  </ul>

<p>Drop-downs also involve some new concepts:
<ul>
  <li>finding a child element
    
  <li>determining whether an element is shown or hidden
    
  <li>event propagation
</ul>

<p>This will take us a few steps, so be patient.

<h2>Positioning</h2>

<p>When we first learned about <code>.hide()</code>
  and <code>.show()</code>, the page would have to be re-arranged based on
  whether the target element was shown or hidden. Try the following
  example, clicking on the <q>header</q> list item:

<ul>
  <li id="ex1">header
    <ul>
      <li>Harry</li>
      <li>Ron</li>
      <li>Hermione</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
  
<script id="ex1-code">
function toggle1() {
    var child = $("#ex1 ul");
    var display = child.css("display");
    if( display == "none" ) {
        child.show();
    } else {
        child.hide();
    }
}
$("#ex1").click(toggle1);
</script>

<p>Notice how the page (particularly this paragraph) jumps up and down
  based on whether the submenu is shown?  We don't want that with a
  drop-down menu.

<p>We solve this by using <code>position:absolute</code> on the menu,
  and positioning it relative to the header. Here it is in action:

<div id="ex2-html">
<ul>
  <li id="ex2">header
    <ul>
      <li>Harry</li>
      <li>Ron</li>
      <li>Hermione</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<style id="ex2-css" scoped>
#ex2 {
    position: relative;
    height: 6em;
}
#ex2 ul {
    position: absolute;
    top: auto;
    left: auto;
}
</style>

<script id="ex2-script">
function toggle2() {
    var child = $("#ex2 ul");
    var display = child.css("display");
    if( display == "none" ) {
        child.show();
    } else {
        child.hide();
    }
}
$("#ex2").click(toggle2);
</script>

<p>The html code looks like this:

<pre id="ex2-html-code" class="prettyprint lang-html"></pre>

<script>
document.getElementById("ex2-html-code").innerText = document.getElementById("ex2-html").innerHTML;
</script>

<p>And the CSS like this: 

<pre id="ex2-css-code" class="prettyprint lang-css"></pre>

<script>
document.getElementById("ex2-css-code").innerText = document.getElementById("ex2-css").innerHTML;
</script>

<p>The <code>auto</code> value makes the browser calculate the value to
  use, thereby positioning the menu in the same place as it was in the
  first example, but using absolute positioning.  We added
  the <code>height</code> just so the menu wouldn't overlap this paragraph
  when it was shown.

<h2>Toggling</h2>

<p>Now let's turn to the JavaScript. Let's start with toggling whether
something is open or closed, as we did above.  Here's the JavaScript code
for the previous example:

<pre id="ex2-code" class="prettyprint lang-js"></pre>
<script>
document.getElementById("ex2-code").innerText = document.getElementById("ex2-script").innerText;
</script>

<p>The event handler gets the menu, using the selector <code>#ex2
    ul</code>, and determines whether it is hidden. It's hidden when its
    CSS is <code>display:none</code>, which we can determine via an
    alternate usage of the <code>.css()</code> method.  We're accustomed
    to a 2-argument usage, like this:

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-js linenumbers executable">
$(selector).css("property","value");
</pre>

  <p>Instead we have this:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js linenumbers executable">
var curr = $(selector).css("property");
</pre>

<p>This usage reads the current value of the property.  In this case,
  we're reading the <code>display</code> property and putting it in a
  variable of the same name. The next lines check the value and if it's
  "none", the child is hidden, so we should <code>show()</code> it,
  otherwise, <code>hide()</code> it.

<p>If we replaced those list items (Harry, Ron, and Hermione) with
  hyperlinks, we actually have a working drop-down menu:

<ul id="ex3">
  <li>Main Character Menu
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Harry_Potter">Harry</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Ron_Weasley">Ron</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hermione_Granger">Hermione</a></li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<style scoped>
#ex3 {
    position: relative;
    height: 6em;
}
#ex3 ul {
    position: absolute;
    top: auto;
    left: auto;
}
</style>

<script id="ex3-script">
function toggle3() {
    var child = $("#ex3 ul");
    var display = child.css("display");
    if( display == "none" ) {
        child.show();
    } else {
        child.hide();
    }
}
$("#ex3").click(toggle3);
</script>

<p>Presto! A drop-down menu!

<h2>Multiple Menus</h2>

<p>Chances are, you will have multiple drop-down menus, like this:

<div id="ex4">
<ul>
  <li id="ex4a" class="has_submenu">Characters
    <ul>
      <li>Harry</li>
      <li>Ron</li>
      <li>Herminone</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li id="ex4b" class="has_submenu">Houses
    <ul>
      <li>Gryffindor</li>
      <li>Hufflepuff</li>
      <li>Ravenclaw</li>
      <li>Slytherin</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li id="ex4c" class="has_submenu">Teachers
    <ul>
      <li>Dumbledore</li>
      <li>Flitwick</li>
      <li>McGonagal</li>
      <li>Snape</li>
      <li>Sprout</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>We've done a little CSS magic to lay those out horizontally. Note that
    we use several selectors of the form <code>A &gt; B</code>. That is a
    <em>child</em> selector, which is a variant on the descendant
    selectors that we already know, but instead of B being any descendant
    of A, B must be a <em>child</em> of A.
  
<style id="ex4-css" scoped>
  #ex4 {
      height: 12em;
  }

  #ex4 > ul {
      list-style-type: none;
  }

  #ex4 > ul > li {
      display: inline-block;
      height: 2em;
      width: 10em;
      vertical-align: top;
      border: 2px solid teal;
      background-color: #ffffcc;
  }
</style>

<pre id="ex4-css-code" class="prettyprint lang-css"></pre>
<script>
document.getElementById("ex4-css-code").innerText = document.getElementById("ex4-css").innerText;
</script>

<script id="ex4a-script">
function toggle4a() {
    var child = $("#ex4a ul");
    var display = child.css("display");
    if( display == "none" ) {
        child.show();
    } else {
        child.hide();
    }
}

$("#ex4a").click(toggle4a);
</script>

<script id="ex4bc-script">
function toggle4() {
    var child = $(this).find("ul");
    var display = child.css("display");
    if( display == "none" ) {
        child.show();
    } else {
        child.hide();
    }
}

$("#ex4b, #ex4c").click(toggle4);
</script>

<p>Let's take a look at the JavaScript code to toggle these menus (at
  least the first one):

<pre id="ex4a-js-code" class="prettyprint lang-js linenumbers executable">
</pre>

<script>
document.getElementById("ex4a-js-code").innerText = document.getElementById("ex4a-script").innerText;
</script>

<p>The code is the same as before, but we'd need two more copies of it
  (suitably modified), one for each sub-menu.  Later in the course, if
  there's time, we'll discuss a better, more abstract way to do this.
  For now, if you'd like, we'll turn to an important but complicated
  improvement.

<h2 id="click-anywhere-to-close" class="line">Click Anywhere to Close</h2>

<p>There's one small flaw with our drop-down menus, and that is the
  expectation that users have. If they open a menu and then decide that
  they don't want to go to any of those pages, they have to click again on
  the header to close the menu.  Most people are used to being able to
  click anywhere else on the page to close an open menu.

<p>Doing that is cool and worthwhile, but tricky and requires some
  additional concepts.  The first concept is putting an event handler on
  the whole document (the top of the DOM tree). That event handler will
  close the open menu. Let's go back to a simpler menu, but with our first
  attempt at that behavior.  Try the following, which doesn't work. We'll
  soon see why, but for now, let's try to understand this attempt.

<div id="ex5-html">
<ul>
  <li id="ex5" class="has-submenu">header
    <ul>
      <li>Harry</li>
      <li>Ron</li>
      <li>Hermione</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<style id="ex5-css" scoped>
#ex5-html {
    height: 6em;
}

#ex5 {
    position: relative;
}
#ex5 ul {
    position: absolute;
    top: auto;
    left: auto;
}
</style>

<script id="ex5-script">
var ex5counter = 0;

function log5(text) {
    ex5counter++;
    console.log(ex5counter+": "+text);
}

function toggle5() {
    var child = $("#ex5 ul");
    var display = child.css("display");
    if( display == "none" ) {
        log5("showing submenu");
        child.show();
    } else {
        log5("hiding submenu");
        child.hide();
    }
}
$("#ex5-html .has-submenu").click(toggle5);
</script>


<script id="ex5-closeall">
function closeAll() {
    log5("hiding all submenus");
    $(".has-submenu ul").hide();
}

closeAll();

$(document).click(closeAll)
</script>

<p>Here's the source code for the additional behavior, which adds an event
    handler on the document that closes everything, so that we can close
    an open menu by clicking someplace else in the document.

<pre id="ex5-closeall-code" class="prettyprint lang-js"></pre>  

<script>
document.getElementById("ex5-closeall-code").innerText = document.getElementById("ex5-closeall").innerText;
</script>

<p>Note that we named the function <code>closeAll</code>, because it will
  close any open menu on the screen. As we've seen, there might be
  multiple menus, and this function won't necessarily know which one is
  open, if any. We could go to a lot of effort to figure out which menu is
  open, or we could just use the power of jQuery to close every one of
  them, whether they are open or not. We prefer the simpler approach. That
  is to put a CSS <em>class</em> on each header LI and then select every
  UL child of those LI elements.  We then invoke the <code>.hide()</code>
  method on them.

<p>You'll notice that the menu is initially hidden, which is what we
  usually want to do with drop-down menus. We do this by invoking
  the <code>closeAll</code> function in our code, above.

<p>We then attach the <code>closeAll</code> function as a click handler to
  the document.

<p>But why doesn't clicking on the header work to open the sub-menu?  Is
  the event handler even running? Let's look more closely at the code:

<pre id="ex5-js-code" class="prettyprint lang-js linenumbers executable"></pre>

<script>
document.getElementById("ex5-js-code").innerText = document.getElementById("ex5-script").innerText;
</script>

<p>First, we defined a <code>log5</code> function. That's just for
  debugging: it prints a message to the JS console, along with a counter,
  so we can tell one message from another. Next, the same event handler
  code as before, only augmented with the <code>log5</code> calls.

<p>Now, open your JS console and try clicking on the header. You'll see
  that the <code>toggle5</code> function is indeed being invoked,
  but the <code>closeAll</code> <em>function is also invoked!</em>. So,
  the menu is opened and instantaneously closed.  Why?

<p>The answer is that clicking on the header not only counts as clicking
  on the header but <em>also</em> counts as clicking on the document.

<h2>Event Bubbling</h2>

<p>In retrospect, it makes sense that clicking on the element also counts
  as clicking on the document, but it's still surprising. This phenomenon
  is called <em>event bubbling</em>, because an event bubbles up the DOM
  tree from the leaves to the root, like champagne bubbles going from the
  bottom to the top of the glass. Every element
  on the path from the leaf (like the LI) to the root (the document) gets
  a chance to react to the event.  It's also called <em>event
  propagation</em>.

<p>In this case, the normal event bubbling gets in our way. Is there a way
  to cancel the event propagation? Yes, but it takes a few steps.

<p>First, our event handler is, in fact, invoked with an argument; it's
  just that we've been ignoring it up to now. jQuery ensures that our
  event handlers is invoked with an object that represents the event,
  including information about what event it was (click, mouse motion,
  keyboard events) and stuff like that. That event object has a method
  called <code>stopPropagation()</code>, which does exactly what we want.

<p>So, our new and improved <code>toggle</code> function is going to
  accept an argument that is an event object, and it will use that
  argument to stop the propagation of this event up the tree:

<div id="ex6-html">
<ul>
  <li id="ex6" class="has-submenu">header
    <ul>
      <li>Harry</li>
      <li>Ron</li>
      <li>Hermione</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<style id="ex6-css" scoped>
#ex6-html {
    height: 6em;
}

#ex6 {
    position: relative;
}
#ex6 ul {
    position: absolute;
    top: auto;
    left: auto;
}
</style>

<script id="ex6-script">
function toggle6(eventObj) {
    var child = $("#ex6 ul");
    var display = child.css("display");
    if( display == "none" ) {
        log5("showing submenu");
        child.show();
    } else {
        log5("hiding submenu");
        child.hide();
    }
    eventObj.stopPropagation();
}
$("#ex6-html .has-submenu").click(toggle6);
</script>

<p>Here's the source code for fancy new <code>toggle6</code> function:

<pre id="ex6-code" class="prettyprint lang-js"></pre>  

<script>
document.getElementById("ex6-code").innerText = document.getElementById("ex6-script").innerText;
</script>

<p>Try it!

<p>You're now prepared to understand all the code in
  this <a href="drop-down/drop-down.html">drop-down
  example</a>.
