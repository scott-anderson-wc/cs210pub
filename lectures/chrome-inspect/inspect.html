              The default browser we will use in this course is Chrome. This means that all
              your assignments should first work well on Chrome and only if you desire, you can
              make changes to make things look the same on the other browsers. For your project,
              once you have everything working on Chrome, you might consider adjusting the CSS
              rules to fix problems on the other browsers such as Firefox and Internet Explorer.
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
              The reason for choosing Chrome is that according to W3School's
              <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp">browser use statistics</a>, 
              Chrome is currently the most used browser on the Web. Statistics from the 
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers">Wikipedia article</a>
              are a bit different from those of W3Schools, but both agree on the dominance of Chrome.
              In previous years our choice has been Firefox, but since its usage share has fallen 
              dramatically, we are switching to Chrome.

          <h2 id="tools">Developer Tools</h2>
          <p>All browsers have tools to help developers understand how their HTML, CSS, and Javasript
          code is being interpreted by the browser. In these notes you will become familiar with Chrome's 
          developer tools, most importantly the Inspect Element window. In the future, we will also talk
          about how to use the Console to debug Javascript applications.</p>
          
          <p>You can access the Elements window in several ways, choose one that you are comfortable with:
            <ul>
              <li>Using the mouse (or trackpad): right-click and choose Inspect Element on the drop-down menu.</li>
              <li>Using the menu of Chrome: View | Developer | Developer Tools</li>
              <li>Using the keyboard: In Mac: Cmd + Opt + I; In Windows: Ctrl + Shift + I</li>
            </ul>
          A new window will open at the bottom of your current web page. This window is usually docked
          in this position, but you can use the docking icon <img src="images/dock.png" alt="dock icon"> to
          dock/undock it from the main window. Figure 1 shows the complete screenshot of a web page and
          the dev tools at the bottom.
          </p>

          </figure>
          
          <h3>The Elements window and the Web page</h3>
          <p>The first thing to notice in the Elements window is that it is divided in two
            panes, on the left side we see a tree-representation of the nested structure of 
            the HTML document (similar to that of folder and files in programs such as Finder (Mac)
            or Windows Explorer). On the right side there is a series of tabs, opened on Styles,
            showing what styles are applied to the selected element and how the browser
            has calculated the box that contains the element.
            
          <p>By selecting an element in the tree representation and hovering the mouse over it,
            one can see how the corresponding area in the Web page is highlighted in blue,
            also showing a little yellow box with the width x height dimensions of the element's content box.
            In Figure 1, we notice in the upper part that the whole document is highlighted, because
            we have selected the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element (in the Elements window). 
        </p>
            
        <p>Spend a few minutes navigating the document tree and highlighting different tags, to see
        the corresponding box on the Web page.</p>
          
        <!--h3 id="item3">Calculating Styles</h3>
          <p>An important feature of the Inspector is that it allows us to understand what styles
            the browser is applying to an element. At the beginning are shown the styles that come
            from the user provided stylesheet (with a reference to the file name and line number 
            where the style appears), then, the user agent (browser) styleshet applied to the 
            element is shown as well. 
        </p-->
           
        
          <h3>Your Exploration Task</h3>
          <p><strong>Download</strong> the HTML file <code>wellesley.html</code> that you used in 
            <a href="/~cs110/labs/lab02/part2/">Lab 2</a>
            and open it with your browser. This should be the file that doesn't link
            to the stylesheet you generated in Lab.
            Open the Inspect Element window and start exploring
            the document tree. Notice how elements are nested in each other, e.g., <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>
            is nested in <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>'s are nested
            in <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> is nested in 
            <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>, etc. 
            
          <p>Click on one of the elements, for example the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag
          for Hillary Clinton and then inspect what you see in the Styles pane. Because
            you haven't specified your own style for the page, the listed styles are the ones
            provided by the browser (the user agent). Figure 2 shows the default style for 
            <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>. For the moment, don't worry about the complicated name of the selector
            (<code>a:-webkit-any-link</code>), simply think that it is the style for <code>a</code>. Also,
            notice how below the rule for <code>a</code>, the rules inhereted from its ancestors: <code>li</code> and
            <code>ul</code> are shown.
          </p>
          
          <figure class="text-center">
            <img src="images/style_a.png" alt="screenshot default styles for selector a"
                 class="img-thumbnail">
            <figcaption>Figure 2: Default styles provided by the browser for <code>a</code>.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          
        <p>However, you might be confused by styles such as <code>color: -webkit-link</code>,
          because the value it's not a kind of color. The reason for this is that the browser
          keeps a table where every value such as <code>-webkit-link</code> is mapped
          to a real value. You can see the results of this mapping in the <q>Computed</q> tab, 
          as shown in Figure 3.
        </p>
        
          <figure class="text-center">
            <img src="images/computed_a.png" alt="screenshot computed styles for selector a"
                 class="img-thumbnail">
            <figcaption>Figure 3: Computed styles for the selector <code>a</code>.</figcaption>
          </figure>
        
        <p>
          Notice how now the <code>color</code> property has a real value now (don't worry if you
          don't understand the <code>rgb(85,26,139)</code> value for the moment, it's a way to
          represent colors with numbers, which we will discuss very soon).
        </p>

          <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
              <h4>Things to try on your own</h4>
            <p>For the <code>wellesley.html</code> document (without CSS styling), explore the
            default styles for each element and look at what properties and values these styles have.        
            </p>
            <p>Here are some questions to ask yourself and figure out during the exploration:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Which elements have the property <code>display</code> and what kind of values does this
              property take?</li>
              <li>What can you say about the elements that don't have a <code>display</code> property?
              (For such cases, look at the "Computed" tab as well.</li>
              <li>Select the element <code>h1</code> in the document tree, then hover with the mouse
              over the colored box (it has the words: margin, border, padding). What do you see in the 
              web page as you perform this hovering? Repeat the same for the element <code>ul</code>.</li>
              <li>Do you understand what the numbers in the box mean?</li>
              <li>Resize your browser page, then click on the button reload 
                <img src="images/reload.png" alt="browser button reload">. Which numbers in the box changed?
              </li>
              <li>Can you figure out the relation between the unit <code>em</code> and <code>px</code>,
              both used in the styles? Refer to the "Computed" tab for some help.</li>
              <li>Select the element <code>nav</code> and then the element <code>footer</code>.
              What can you say about the selector or the rule?</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        
          <p>Now that you have explored the default styles provided by the browser, you can move on to explore
          what happens when you add your own stylesheet. For this, download your own <code>lab2</code> folder
        that you worked on the Lab. You should have a version of <code>wellesley.html</code> that is linked to a
        <code>style.css</code> file on which you worked on the lab.</p>
        
        <div class="alert alert-danger">
          If you didn't have time to upload on your account the work you did during lab, the <code>lab2</code>
          folder in the <code>cs110dl</code> account has a second subfolder, titled <code>wellesleystyled</code>.
          There you find the solution for the lab2 exercises.        
        </div>
        
        <p></p></;>In a new browser window open this second HTML
        file and open "Inspect Element". Try to compare how the "Styles" pane looks for elements you have styled.
        For an example, see in Figure 4 the before-and-after comparison for the <code>h1</code> element.</p>
        
        <figure>
            <img src="images/h1.png" alt="screenshot of defaults styles for h1"
                 class="img-thumbnail" width="400px">
            <img src="images/h1_style.png" alt="screenshot of user-defined styles for h1"
                 class="img-thumbnail" width="400px">
            <figcaption>Figure 4: Default styling for <code>h1</code> (left) and user-defined styles (right).</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        
        <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
        <h4>More Questions</h4>
        <p>To answer the following questions, you might need to compare several elements from the unstyled and
          styled document.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Has the box size for <code>h1</code> changed? Explain how this is possible.</li>
          <li>Can you come up with the formula that calculates the entire box size that each element occupies in the page?</li>
          <li>Which are all the different ways that you can influence this box size through the stylesheet?</li>
        </ol>
