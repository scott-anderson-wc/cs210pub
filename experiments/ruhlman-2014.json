Our study explores a genetic and epigenetic mouse model   of schizophrenia, by examining GCPII/AAV-modified mice. This model   begins with a genetic mutation thought to be implicated in the aberrant   expression of the neurotransmitter glutamate, which is hypothesized to   be associated with schizophrenia in   humans.

Their ascent into stardom was realized through the hard   work of figures like Igor Stravinsky, Erik Satie, Pablo Picasso, and their   founder Serge Diaghilev.  Alongside these figures, patronesses like the   Comtesse Greffulhe, the Princesse de Polignac, Misia Sert, and Coco Chanel   contributed greatly to the ballet troupe in four different ways.  Yet   very few scholars have recognized these women for their significant   contributions to the musical, artistic, and financial aspects of the Ballets   Russes.  Their involvement included work on productions such as Parade,   Les Noces and Le Train Bleu, and these four women’s roles greatly affected   the legacy of the Ballets Russes that remains today.

    "textsearch": "The Powerhouses of   Parisian Society: Effects of Female Patrons on the Ballets Russes The   Ballet Russes dominated the avant-garde world of early twentieth century   Paris with ballets that brought together the greatest artistic and musical   minds of the time. Their ascent into stardom was realized through the hard   work of figures like Igor Stravinsky, Erik Satie, Pablo Picasso, and their   founder Serge Diaghilev.  Alongside these figures, patronesses like the   Comtesse Greffulhe, the Princesse de Polignac, Misia Sert, and Coco Chanel   contributed greatly to the ballet troupe in four different ways.  Yet   very few scholars have recognized these women for their significant   contributions to the musical, artistic, and financial aspects of the Ballets   Russes.  Their involvement included work on productions such as Parade,   Les Noces and Le Train Bleu, and these four women’s roles greatly affected   the legacy of the Ballets Russes that remains today.

These disquieting interiors   not only suggest the artist’s personal encounter with illness in his shared   family home, but also the general spirit of malaise and obsession with   morbidity that pervaded turn-of-the-century Paris. His portrayal of the   invalid woman evokes the then-common practice of deathbed photography, and   his treatment of interior space suggests the dwelling as a polluted and   diseased environment. Vuillard subverts the conventional bourgeois conception   of the home as a haven, and through a “microbial” aesthetic and a   claustrophobic manipulation of space, imbues its very walls with the threat   of contagion. My re-historicization of Vuillard within the Parisian medical   milieu offers a new understanding of the uncanny reverberations in his   deceivingly warm and intimate domestic scenes.

    "textsearch": "Adverse Selection in   the Great Irish Tontines of 1773, 1775, and 1777 Adverse   selection is an undesired market outcome that occur when there is assymetric   information between the buyers and sellers. For example, in the insurance   market, people who know they have a higher risk of claiming than the   average of the group are more likely to buy the insurance, hence raising the   premium of the product for all other policyholders.  My thesis studies the problem of adverse   selection in the late 18th century British life annuity market, in   particular, the “Irish tontine” issued in 1773, 1775 and 1777. Identifying   and measuring adverse selection in today’s insurance market has been proven   difficult given the market’s complexity. I hope to shed light on a   challenging modern empirical question from a new perspective - economic   history.<br>   <br>    <br>   <br>     11:00am 12:10pm PNW-212 33  Yikang Li 2014 Mathematics and Economics "

    "description": "Light   is a taxing environmental challenge to plants. Although it is necessary for   photosynthesis, light in excess of what can be used for photosynthesis can   inflict cellular damage, reduce photosynthetic ability, decrease growth, and   strain fitness. Despite their immobility, plants manage to tolerate an   impressive range of environmental light conditions through a variety of   sophisticated acclimation responses. One mechanism plants utilize to   acclimate to the drastically changing light variations of the natural world   is chloroplast movement. Chloroplast movement involves the physical   rearrangement of chloroplasts within the cell to either avoid or maximize   light absorption. In addition to chloroplast movement, plants rely on   non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), also known as heat dissipation, to   minimize light-induced damage through the conversion and subsequent   dissipation of excess light into heat. In the Königer lab, we evaluate the   relative importance of these fast acclimation responses toward the plant’s   fitness by studying various Arabidopsis thaliana mutants that   exhibit genetic impairments related to chloroplast movement or NPQ. In   addition, we investigate how different light conditions during growth affect   the degree to which plants rely on these mechanisms. Our current   investigations have shown that chloroplast movement and NPQ are sensitive to   environmental light conditions during growth. In fact, plants grown under   higher light exhibit chloroplast movement to a lesser degree than plants   grown under lower light. This may be attributed to differences in   chloroplast arrangement between high light plants and low light plants.    Additionally, we observed a trend where plants grown under higher light   exhibited greater NPQ abilities than plants grown under lower   light. Collectively, these findings suggest that a plant’s chloroplast   movement and NPQ mechanisms are flexible to environmental modulation. ",

    "description": "Authenticity   in relationships, defined as the ability to be open and honest with others   about one’s genuine thoughts and feelings, has been found to be positively   related to interpersonal relationships. In contrast, lower levels of   authenticity, or speaking and acting in opposition to how one really feels,   lead to internalizing symptoms such as anxiety and depression. This study   explores factors that contribute to the development of authenticity.   Adolescents’ emotion regulation processes and perceptions of parental   validation and support are expected to predict authenticity in relationships   with parents. Further, level of parental support is expected to moderate the   relation between emotion regulation and authenticity. For example,   adolescents who have difficulty regulating their emotions, but who have   supportive parents, are more likely to be authentic in their relationships.   This research will contribute to our understanding of the development of   authenticity. The findings will have theoretical and practical   implications for adolescent mental health.

We examined whether future thinking is also   influenced by mood in a similar way: Do people imagine more positive or more   negative future events depending on their mood? Furthermore, research   suggests that events further in the future are seen more positively than   those closer in time. Thus, we examined whether imagined future events were   further away in time when participants were in a positive mood than when they   were in a negative mood.

In addition, we are investigating the bioactivity of simplified   coumarin derivatives (inspired by the natural product Angelmarin) against   pancreatic cancer cell lines.

Though the 43 color photographs   that chronicle her parade piece serve as one of O&#39;Grady&#39;s least known works,   the remarkable manner in which she reclaims subjectivity, personhood, and the   sanguine liveliness of the black community should not go overlooked.    <br>   <br>    <br>   <br>     9:30am 10:40am SCI-104 63  Camylle J.

The later version boasts all the   riches of the orchestra, but what of the original version, composed as   Berlioz originally intended the music to be heard? Although it is less   admired today, the intimate piano-voice version reflects the special   partnership between singer and pianist that Berlioz originally envisioned for   the songs.

However, previous studies on I. oxyrinchus have yielded conflicting   results regarding the presence of genetic population substructure within this   species. Therefore, I conducted an experiment with the aim of assessing the   population genetic structure of I. oxyrinchus both globally and regionally.   This was accomplished by analyzing mtCO1 gene sequences and by performing RAD   (Restriction Site Associated DNA) sequencing on North Carolinian I.   oxyrinchus samples, making this the first study to perform RAD sequencing on   a shark species.

Global average temperatures cooled, leading to major ice sheet   growth in East Antarctica. Evidence for this ice sheet growth includes   proxies such as sea level records, sediment records and oxygen isotopes, as   presented in a variety of previous studies. In order to further examine the   variation in movement of East Antarctica’s ice sheet growth, we have measured   the amount of ice rafted detritus (IRD) deposited in sediment in the Southern   Ocean off the margin of East Antarctica. Here we examined sediments from    Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 318, Site U1356,   (core 19R, sections 1-5), we determined the clast count and examined the   lithic grains from the sediment deposited about 14 million years ago. We   processed 41 samples by first drying the samples, then washing the samples   through a 63 µm sieve. After drying the &gt;63µm portion of the sample, we   further sort the sample into three parts: 63-150µm, 150µm-1mm and &gt;1mm. We   examined and classified the lithic grains in the &gt;1mm portion of our   samples. These lithic grains are IRD. Our data adds to the initial shipboard   data. Both the shipboard data and our data indicate that there were several   large pulses of IRD during the MMCT. Previous data from benthic oxygen   isotope records tell us that this was a dynamic time in the growth and   retreat of the Antarctic ice sheets, but this is the first time that we have   direct evidence from sediments derived by ice rafting that confirms the   benthic oxygen isotope data. ",

    "description": "Nowadays,   children use computers for everything. However, research shows that children   often learn best when they are physically engaged. Body movements, the   ability to touch, manipulate, and build sensory awareness of relationships in   the physical world are crucial to development. When a child is given a new   toy with many unique functions and features, they are often more fascinated   by the cardboard box it came in. With that observation, we present Magicbox,   the concept of a modular toy kit that enhances the experience of playing with   cardboard boxes. Magicbox combines elements of simple circuitry and   electronics to augment creative possibilities for children to make playful   environments with any cardboard box. By abstracting circuitry to boxes, we allow   children to explore the systems without knowing exactly what to expect. This   lends to learning by experimenting and could develop exploratory learning   skills.  We wish to present three prototypes that utilize sensors,   microcontrollers, and creative uses of conductive material to explore the   Magicbox concept. http://magicbox2013.wordpress.com/",

We aim to engineer two novel devices   that serve as drug-delivery vehicles with the potential to improve treatment   options for late-stage pancreatic cancer and diseases that are currently   attributed to medication non-adherence. One project, a collaborative effort,   is creating a nano-vehicle composed of an iron-oxide core coated with a gold   shell that provides targeted damageto cancer cells while being tracked in   vivo with magnetic resonance imaging. Functionalization of the gold shell   relies upon a biomolecular system anchored to the nano-vehicle through   “stealth” polymer linkers which also add stability to the nanovehicle. A   second biomolecule that targets a cell surface receptor expressed by many   pancreatic tumors, and the therapeutic agent for boron-neutron capture   therapy are also attached to the gold shell through other species. The second   project is developing a Janus device that has unique capacity for extended   gastrointestinal retention and release with an omniphobic side and a mucosal   adhesive side. Respectively, this dual layer will enable repulsion of the   food stream and allow attachment to the wall of the gastrointestinal tract. (Research   supported by a Jerome A.

Functionalization of the gold shell   relies upon a biomolecular system anchored to the nano-vehicle through   “stealth” polymer linkers which also add stability to the nanovehicle. A   second biomolecule that targets a cell surface receptor expressed by many   pancreatic tumors, and the therapeutic agent for boron-neutron capture   therapy are also attached to the gold shell through other species. The second   project is developing a Janus device that has unique capacity for extended   gastrointestinal retention and release with an omniphobic side and a mucosal   adhesive side. Respectively, this dual layer will enable repulsion of the   food stream and allow attachment to the wall of the gastrointestinal tract. (Research   supported by a Jerome A.

Although   treatments for melanoma, a skin cancer that has higher rates of recurrence,   metastasis, and death, are highly standardized, there are no precise   nationwide guidelines in place for treating high-risk CSCC. However, it is   estimated that CSCC and melanoma cause a similar number of deaths each year,   which suggests a need for better characterization and evaluation of current   CSCC treatments. For my senior thesis project in the biological sciences, I   evaluated the treatment of 136 high-risk CSCC tumors that were diagnosed   between 2000 and 2013 at Boston&#39;s Brigham and Women Hospital, with the goal   of characterizing recent treatment strategies for high-risk CSCC and   evaluating treatment efficacy.

    "textsearch": "Management of   High-Risk Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma About   700,000 cases of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), a type of skin   cancer, are diagnosed annually in the U.S. Most of these cases are highly   curable, but some tumors are high risk and can recur (5% of cases),   metastasize (4% of cases), or cause death (1.5% of cases). Although   treatments for melanoma, a skin cancer that has higher rates of recurrence,   metastasis, and death, are highly standardized, there are no precise   nationwide guidelines in place for treating high-risk CSCC. However, it is   estimated that CSCC and melanoma cause a similar number of deaths each year,   which suggests a need for better characterization and evaluation of current   CSCC treatments. For my senior thesis project in the biological sciences, I   evaluated the treatment of 136 high-risk CSCC tumors that were diagnosed   between 2000 and 2013 at Boston&#39;s Brigham and Women Hospital, with the goal   of characterizing recent treatment strategies for high-risk CSCC and   evaluating treatment efficacy.

    "description": "In   an increasingly globalized world, contemporary Hollywood has capitalized on   sustained interest in Eastern cultures in the West by adapting several   popular novels and television shows into big budget, feature-length films   with all-star casts headed by some of the world’s most acclaimed directors.   However, such adaptations have historically been mired in racially-charged   stereotypes that displace and absent Asian bodies and voices from popular   visual media in America. This thesis examines recent blockbusters such as   Memoirs of a Geisha (2005, Rob Marshall), The Last Airbender (2010, M. Night   Shaymalan), and Cloud Atlas (2012, Andy and Lana Wachowski; Tom Twyker)   through the lenses of post-structuralism, feminist theory, and critical race   theory, and looks at the ways in which a film adapted from an Eastern-centric   source strengthens, reacts to, or criticizes mainstream portrayals of “the   Orient” with the endgoal of contextualizing the roles of Asian Americans in   our supposed post-racial society.",

    "textsearch": "21st Century   Orientals: The Displacement of Eastern Identities in the Contemporary   Hollywood Adaptation In   an increasingly globalized world, contemporary Hollywood has capitalized on   sustained interest in Eastern cultures in the West by adapting several   popular novels and television shows into big budget, feature-length films   with all-star casts headed by some of the world’s most acclaimed directors.   However, such adaptations have historically been mired in racially-charged   stereotypes that displace and absent Asian bodies and voices from popular   visual media in America. This thesis examines recent blockbusters such as   Memoirs of a Geisha (2005, Rob Marshall), The Last Airbender (2010, M. Night   Shaymalan), and Cloud Atlas (2012, Andy and Lana Wachowski; Tom Twyker)   through the lenses of post-structuralism, feminist theory, and critical race   theory, and looks at the ways in which a film adapted from an Eastern-centric   source strengthens, reacts to, or criticizes mainstream portrayals of “the   Orient” with the endgoal of contextualizing the roles of Asian Americans in   our supposed post-racial society. 9:30am 10:40am SCI-104 91  Annie Wang 2014 Art   History and Cinema &amp; Media Studies "

E and P elicit   these effects by binding to their respective intracellular receptors, which   are transcription factors. There are two forms of progestin receptors (PR):   the full-length PR-B and the shorter PR-A. These PR isoforms have distinct   roles in rodent reproductive behavior and physiology. However, how one   isoform is selectively expressed is not known. Two steroid receptor   coactivators (SRC-1 and SRC-2) facilitate the expression of PR.

FXS is a single gene   disorder caused by the loss of an mRNA-binding protein, FMRP. Because there   is a lack of regulation on the translational process, there is increased   protein synthesis at synapses, thought to account for many behavioral   phenotypes in Fragile X. This project uses a novel behavioral assay   in Fmr1 KO mice to test whether indirect pharmacological   down-regulation of mGluR5-mediated signaling is sufficient to correct the   phenotype. We are measuring the cognitive flexibility of cross-mice to   determine if loss of FMRP can be corrected by targeting the mGluR5 pathway.   We are interested in extinction of a learned behavior because of noted   cognitive flexibility issues in Fmr1 KO mice and believe that   extinction is a viable measure of cognitive flexibility.

    "textsearch": "Two-Choice   Extinction: A Behavioral Assay for Cognitive Flexibility in the Mouse Model   of Fragile X Fragile   X syndrome (FXS), the leading known cause of Autism spectrum disorder, is the   most common form of inherited mental retardation. FXS is a single gene   disorder caused by the loss of an mRNA-binding protein, FMRP. Because there   is a lack of regulation on the translational process, there is increased   protein synthesis at synapses, thought to account for many behavioral   phenotypes in Fragile X. This project uses a novel behavioral assay   in Fmr1 KO mice to test whether indirect pharmacological   down-regulation of mGluR5-mediated signaling is sufficient to correct the   phenotype. We are measuring the cognitive flexibility of cross-mice to   determine if loss of FMRP can be corrected by targeting the mGluR5 pathway.   We are interested in extinction of a learned behavior because of noted   cognitive flexibility issues in Fmr1 KO mice and believe that   extinction is a viable measure of cognitive flexibility.

It has been integrated into gaming consoles   and mobile devices, and has been researched for its potential in programs   that range from medical training simulations to collaborative workspaces. 3D   is another growing facet of technology that is reexamining the possibilities   of the user experience. The zSpace platform is the first-generation of   computing hardware that simulates realistic, holographic, 3D, stereoscopic   vision.  Using this system, this research project aimed to study how   haptic feedback can enhance the user interface and understanding of 3D   virtual space, by applying and exploring the effects of different types of   haptic interaction in two zSpace applications. Evaluation included a   comparative analysis of user ability in haptic and non-haptic versions of the   programs, for problem-solving, spatial reasoning, and recognition of physics   and materiality in the virtual environment.<br>   <br>     11:00am 12:10pm SCI-E125 104  Heather H.

An ongoing project   in the lab involves studying the structure-function relationships of histone   derived antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which selectively kill bacterial   cells. A recent collaboration with the Peterman lab seeks to determine the   relative importance of amino acid residues in the Sec14 protein domain, a   lipid transfer domain that is nearly ubiquitous in eukaryotes, for   specifically binding lipids essential to cell signaling.  We will   discuss the computational and experimental methods we use to address these   questions and the insight we have gained into these systems.   1:30pm 2:40pm FND-120 113  Jane E.

In this task rats lick in   response to target tones to receive a water reward and refrain from producing   a motor response on distractor tones. Implanted microelectrodes in the   medio-dorsal frontal and posterior parietal cortices were used to record   local field potentials (LFPs), and frontal-parietal coherence was calculated   for each trial. Coherence analysis is used to measure the degree of   synchronization between neural signals in order to determine if the areas of   the brain are communicating or working with each other. High levels of   theta (4-7 Hz) and alpha (8-13 Hz) coherence between frontal and parietal   were seen in both Go and No-Go trials. Coherence data collection is still   underway, but our preliminary results suggest that greater coherence at low   frequencies is associated with the act of licking and not necessarily   correctly responding.

This problem of   food insecurity has had many solutions suggested for it, including bolstering   the local food supply through supporting small and urban farms. Serving   Ourselves Farm (under Boston Department of Public Health) is one of these;   located on an island in the Boston Harbor, this farm provides most of its 25K   pounds of produce per year to homeless shelters, rehabilitation centers, and   post-incarceration job training programs. The New England weather makes for a   very short growing season already and when the farm loses 90% of its   seedlings, like last spring, as a result of mold from an unregulated growing   environment, their yield is further limited. The farm budget does not allow   for the purchase of a $1000+ climate control system to solve this problem.   Our team&#39;s year-long mission, working with Olin College&#39;s Affordable Design   and Entrepreneurship class and Serving Ourselves, is to develop an affordable   climate control system that will allow small farms to monitor and adjust   their growing environments using pre-existing heaters, lights, and watering   systems, thereby addressing the problems of control and price for our client.

Representing various composers and operas from the past three centuries we   wish to exemplify the relevance of opera in modern times. Within the   performance of five operatic scenes we hope to present the audience with   proof that opera was made and continues to be meant for consumption by the   masses. Opera is not a dead form of music and, in fact, remains relevant to   modern society and can be interpreted in many different fashions. This   interdepartmental approach to music allows us to look at the libretto and   listen the pieces, themselves, to thinking about the composer&#39;s intentions at   the time of composition and the historical relativity of the piece, allowing   us to see into the personality of the characters on stage and also add our   own instincts to develop the character one step further.

    "textsearch": "Opera: Not So Dead   After All Opera combines many different art forms: voice, movement,   costuming and fashion, building sets, and learning performance techniques.   Representing various composers and operas from the past three centuries we   wish to exemplify the relevance of opera in modern times. Within the   performance of five operatic scenes we hope to present the audience with   proof that opera was made and continues to be meant for consumption by the   masses. Opera is not a dead form of music and, in fact, remains relevant to   modern society and can be interpreted in many different fashions. This   interdepartmental approach to music allows us to look at the libretto and   listen the pieces, themselves, to thinking about the composer&#39;s intentions at   the time of composition and the historical relativity of the piece, allowing   us to see into the personality of the characters on stage and also add our   own instincts to develop the character one step further.

Four-, five-, and six-year olds were asked to perform   a neutral action, after which either a good, bad, or neutral   outcome was revealed. Participants were then asked to explain why they   performed the action. Prosocial behavior was measured by allowing   participants to allocate resources to a puppet. We analyzed if the   valence of an outcome played a role in 1) explanation of the cause of   the event, and 2) subsequent sharing behavior. Preliminary results   indicate that children who experienced a bad outcome were more likely   to blame the experimenter for the negative event and share more than   children in the good or neutral outcome conditions.

Although the compound is lethal to 4% of cancer cell lines, the reason for   its lethality is unknown.  This study represents an analysis of the   interaction between Compound 1B and its predicted enzyme target,   phosphodiesterase 3A.  The interaction was analyzed structurally,   mechanistically and functionally.  Ultimately, the understanding of the   effect of Compound 1B on phosphodiesterase 3A will provide insight into the   mechanism of its cytotoxicity.  Understanding the mechanism of   action of Compound 1B in sensitive cell lines is essential for its potential   as a treatment for human cancer.  (Research support provided by the   Schiff Fellowship)<br>   <br>   Solution phase peptide synthesis of thioamide TOP inhibitor<br>   Melissa D’Andrea<br>   Synthesizing an inhibitor of Thimet Oligopeptidase (TOP) may reveal more of   TOP&#39;s function both in vitro and in vivo. A common TOP inhibitor, cFP, (1) is   an effective competitive inhibitor of TOP in vitro; however, in vivo, cFP,   was hydrolyzed. Thus, cFP was not a viable inhibitor. Another TOP inhibitor,   JA-2 (2), was synthesized. JA-2 is non-hydrolyzable in vivo. However, JA-2   resulted in unexpected secondary side effects. Thus, to find out if JA-2   inhibits other proteins besides TOP, another inhibitor must be synthesized.   The goal of this study is to use solution phase peptide synthesis to make a   non-hydrolyzable version of cFP (3): changing the oxygen of the second   alanine to a sulfur. The thioamide version of the cFP inhibitor is expected   to be less susceptible to cleavage in vivo. It is expected that the   thiopeptide may be a more specific inhibitor to TOP than JA-2 as well.<br>   <br>   Monoclonal Antibody Targeted Delivery of Boron Loaded Gold Nanoparticles to   Pancreatic Cancer Cellsfor Boron Neutron Capture therapy<br>   Sara Martin<br>   Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is an aggressive disease with an extremely   high mortality rate. New therapies are needed to treat this deadly disease.   Gold nanoparticles (GNP) are attractive vehicles for cancer therapeutics. The   chemistry of gold allows for easy attachment of therapies. In addition GNPs   can also access tumors through the leaky vasculature. Boron Neutron Capture   Therapy (BNCT) involves localizing non-toxic and non-radioactive Boron-10 to   tumor cells. When a Boron-10 atom is hit with low thermal energy neutrons it   decays into destructive high-energy Lithium ions and ;-particles. By loading   boron onto GNPs the therapeutic delivery to tumors can potentially be   increased. The success of BNCT also relies on targeting the boron   specifically to the tumor in order to localize damage to the tumor. Through   attaching an antibody that recognizes a cell surface protein on pancreatic   adenocarcinoma cells to the GNPs the boron can be directed to the tumor.

Coming from labs   both on and off campus, these students will present their ongoing work,   ranging from organic synthesis to cancer therapy research. <br>   <br>   The Effect of a Novel Cytotoxic Agent on the Kinetics of Phosphodiesterase   3A <br>   Lara Gechijian, Class of 2014, Biochemistry Major<br>   Broad Institute Advisors: Luc de Waal, Matthew Meyerson (PI)<br>   Wellesley Advisor: Didem Vardar-Ulu<br>   Compound 1B is a small molecule with potent anticancer properties.    Although the compound is lethal to 4% of cancer cell lines, the reason for   its lethality is unknown.  This study represents an analysis of the   interaction between Compound 1B and its predicted enzyme target,   phosphodiesterase 3A.  The interaction was analyzed structurally,   mechanistically and functionally.  Ultimately, the understanding of the   effect of Compound 1B on phosphodiesterase 3A will provide insight into the   mechanism of its cytotoxicity.  Understanding the mechanism of   action of Compound 1B in sensitive cell lines is essential for its potential   as a treatment for human cancer.  (Research support provided by the   Schiff Fellowship)<br>   <br>   Solution phase peptide synthesis of thioamide TOP inhibitor<br>   Melissa D’Andrea<br>   Synthesizing an inhibitor of Thimet Oligopeptidase (TOP) may reveal more of   TOP&#39;s function both in vitro and in vivo. A common TOP inhibitor, cFP, (1) is   an effective competitive inhibitor of TOP in vitro; however, in vivo, cFP,   was hydrolyzed. Thus, cFP was not a viable inhibitor. Another TOP inhibitor,   JA-2 (2), was synthesized. JA-2 is non-hydrolyzable in vivo. However, JA-2   resulted in unexpected secondary side effects. Thus, to find out if JA-2   inhibits other proteins besides TOP, another inhibitor must be synthesized.   The goal of this study is to use solution phase peptide synthesis to make a   non-hydrolyzable version of cFP (3): changing the oxygen of the second   alanine to a sulfur. The thioamide version of the cFP inhibitor is expected   to be less susceptible to cleavage in vivo. It is expected that the   thiopeptide may be a more specific inhibitor to TOP than JA-2 as well.<br>   <br>   Monoclonal Antibody Targeted Delivery of Boron Loaded Gold Nanoparticles to   Pancreatic Cancer Cellsfor Boron Neutron Capture therapy<br>   Sara Martin<br>   Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is an aggressive disease with an extremely   high mortality rate. New therapies are needed to treat this deadly disease.   Gold nanoparticles (GNP) are attractive vehicles for cancer therapeutics. The   chemistry of gold allows for easy attachment of therapies. In addition GNPs   can also access tumors through the leaky vasculature. Boron Neutron Capture   Therapy (BNCT) involves localizing non-toxic and non-radioactive Boron-10 to   tumor cells. When a Boron-10 atom is hit with low thermal energy neutrons it   decays into destructive high-energy Lithium ions and ;-particles. By loading   boron onto GNPs the therapeutic delivery to tumors can potentially be   increased. The success of BNCT also relies on targeting the boron   specifically to the tumor in order to localize damage to the tumor. Through   attaching an antibody that recognizes a cell surface protein on pancreatic   adenocarcinoma cells to the GNPs the boron can be directed to the tumor.

Border artists, such as Las Mujeres   de Maiz, a mujeres de color artist collective, work to (re)member their   bodies in reclaiming personal and public terrains. My interests and   explorations as an artist lie in the use of cultural forms to make visible   our bodies and surrounding social structures. Urban mestizaje is a living   alterNative to re-envisioning Chican@ and Latin@ histories in North America,   which straddle the worlds of nepantla, a Nahuatl term connoting in between. I   am interested in the ways urban mestizaje necessitates the use of art,   especially performance, and communidad to feed individual and communal   processes of healing from the open wound of colonial and neoliberal   occupation.<br>   <br>   Wewepahtli: Health and Healing in Santa Ana, CA<br>   Jannet G Sánchez ‘14, Women’s &amp; Gender Studies<br>   In 2004, a Rockefeller Institute study named Santa Ana, CA the ‘toughest   place to live’ in the United States. Santa Ana is home to unemployment, low   education levels, crowded housing and poverty, and it is also a place I call   home. With my interest in health and healing, I embarked on a quest to learn   how Santa Ana residents envision and create health for themselves in the face   of this adversity. My research explores Wewepahtli, the Great Medicine, the   concept that everything is medicine: food, art, sound and includes therapies   such as herbal medicine, talk therapy, and exercise. The use of ancestral   knowledge of holistic and herbal medicine in community-based organizations is   analyzed as a basis for achieving individual and community healing and health   justice.<br>   <br>   “Clothing the Pacific”: An Introduction of the Post-Colonial Body in   Samoa<br>   Elizabeth Torres ’14, Women’s and Gender Studies <br>   In the 21st   century the implications of Christianity continue to influence roles of dress   and appearance in Samoa. In Samoa, dress and appearance abide by many codes   that are shaped and policed by religion; your economic standing; and the   government. In this research contributing factors of dress and appearance   ideals are highlighted and analyzed across a timeline, which helps explain   why Samoans dress and appear the way they do now. For this study fieldwork   was collected through surveys, observations, and personal interviews. In   addition, the study draws from women and gender theories to explain the   implications of patterns and influences on Samoan dress and appearance in the   21st century. Themes of colonialism, neocolonialism, the intersection of   religion and gender highlight the ways in which the Samoan body has been   colonized.<br>   <br>   Leaders, Listeners, and Learners: American Women Who Have ‘Shattered the   Glass Ceiling’<br>   Leah Sams ’14, Women’s and Gender Studies and Public Policy<br>   An analysis   of twenty-two qualitative interviews comparing significant difference in   experience and expectations of women in top academic administrative and   corporate executive leadership positions works to exhibit just how women   ‘shatter the glass ceiling’. Though personal and professional narratives   determine reasons an individual might be tapped, personal narratives in the   lives of corporate executives prove more indicative of an ultimate decision   to take the position. In light of the impact of the intersection of gender,   race, sexuality, and social class on one’s life story, demographics firmly   demonstrate women of all backgrounds can make it to the top. As a majority of   executives were raised in working to middle class households, these data seem   illustrative of an important larger trend: Women leaders have managed to use   factors traditionally working against them as motivation to propel themselves   to the top. (Research supported by a WGST Department stipend.)<br>   <br>   Narratives of Illness and Healing<br>   Alexandra M. Grzywna ’14, English<br>   In surveying narratives written by a diverse group of young U.S. women   diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, my research project is an analysis of the   themes and patterns that emerge at various stages of the illness. I begin by   investigating how these women describe the contributing factors, the   distortions they perceive in their thinking, and their realization of a   disorder. I examine how the illness evolves: how it alters perceptions of   mind and body, relationships with family and friends, and interactions with   healthcare practitioners. I also inspect the triggers for relapse and what   ultimately makes for a successful recovery. I further explore how this   illness affects the women’s conceptualizations of gender, becomes part of   their identities, and brings certain meanings into their lives. Finally, I   look at why these stories are written down, and what they reflect about   modern day U.S. society.Postcards from the Border<br>   Yesenia Trujillo &#39;14, Women’s &amp;   Gender<br>   Studies and Computer Science<br>   Advisors: Irene Mata, Women&#39;s &amp; Gender<br>   Studies and Jennifer Musto, Women&#39;s &amp;<br>   Gender Studies<br>   “La frontera esta mas que sellada.” “Ya no vale<br>   la pena.” These are the phrases   that stick with<br>   me as we are led out of the director’s office into<br>   the patio where about 10 of the migrant men<br>   are sitting.

Border artists, such as Las Mujeres   de Maiz, a mujeres de color artist collective, work to (re)member their   bodies in reclaiming personal and public terrains. My interests and   explorations as an artist lie in the use of cultural forms to make visible   our bodies and surrounding social structures. Urban mestizaje is a living   alterNative to re-envisioning Chican@ and Latin@ histories in North America,   which straddle the worlds of nepantla, a Nahuatl term connoting in between. I   am interested in the ways urban mestizaje necessitates the use of art,   especially performance, and communidad to feed individual and communal   processes of healing from the open wound of colonial and neoliberal   occupation.<br>   <br>   Wewepahtli: Health and Healing in Santa Ana, CA<br>   Jannet G Sánchez ‘14, Women’s &amp; Gender Studies<br>   In 2004, a Rockefeller Institute study named Santa Ana, CA the ‘toughest   place to live’ in the United States. Santa Ana is home to unemployment, low   education levels, crowded housing and poverty, and it is also a place I call   home. With my interest in health and healing, I embarked on a quest to learn   how Santa Ana residents envision and create health for themselves in the face   of this adversity. My research explores Wewepahtli, the Great Medicine, the   concept that everything is medicine: food, art, sound and includes therapies   such as herbal medicine, talk therapy, and exercise. The use of ancestral   knowledge of holistic and herbal medicine in community-based organizations is   analyzed as a basis for achieving individual and community healing and health   justice.<br>   <br>   “Clothing the Pacific”: An Introduction of the Post-Colonial Body in   Samoa<br>   Elizabeth Torres ’14, Women’s and Gender Studies <br>   In the 21st   century the implications of Christianity continue to influence roles of dress   and appearance in Samoa. In Samoa, dress and appearance abide by many codes   that are shaped and policed by religion; your economic standing; and the   government. In this research contributing factors of dress and appearance   ideals are highlighted and analyzed across a timeline, which helps explain   why Samoans dress and appear the way they do now. For this study fieldwork   was collected through surveys, observations, and personal interviews. In   addition, the study draws from women and gender theories to explain the   implications of patterns and influences on Samoan dress and appearance in the   21st century. Themes of colonialism, neocolonialism, the intersection of   religion and gender highlight the ways in which the Samoan body has been   colonized.<br>   <br>   Leaders, Listeners, and Learners: American Women Who Have ‘Shattered the   Glass Ceiling’<br>   Leah Sams ’14, Women’s and Gender Studies and Public Policy<br>   An analysis   of twenty-two qualitative interviews comparing significant difference in   experience and expectations of women in top academic administrative and   corporate executive leadership positions works to exhibit just how women   ‘shatter the glass ceiling’. Though personal and professional narratives   determine reasons an individual might be tapped, personal narratives in the   lives of corporate executives prove more indicative of an ultimate decision   to take the position. In light of the impact of the intersection of gender,   race, sexuality, and social class on one’s life story, demographics firmly   demonstrate women of all backgrounds can make it to the top. As a majority of   executives were raised in working to middle class households, these data seem   illustrative of an important larger trend: Women leaders have managed to use   factors traditionally working against them as motivation to propel themselves   to the top. (Research supported by a WGST Department stipend.)<br>   <br>   Narratives of Illness and Healing<br>   Alexandra M. Grzywna ’14, English<br>   In surveying narratives written by a diverse group of young U.S. women   diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, my research project is an analysis of the   themes and patterns that emerge at various stages of the illness. I begin by   investigating how these women describe the contributing factors, the   distortions they perceive in their thinking, and their realization of a   disorder. I examine how the illness evolves: how it alters perceptions of   mind and body, relationships with family and friends, and interactions with   healthcare practitioners. I also inspect the triggers for relapse and what   ultimately makes for a successful recovery. I further explore how this   illness affects the women’s conceptualizations of gender, becomes part of   their identities, and brings certain meanings into their lives. Finally, I   look at why these stories are written down, and what they reflect about   modern day U.S. society.Postcards from the Border<br>   Yesenia Trujillo &#39;14, Women’s &amp;   Gender<br>   Studies and Computer Science<br>   Advisors: Irene Mata, Women&#39;s &amp; Gender<br>   Studies and Jennifer Musto, Women&#39;s &amp;<br>   Gender Studies<br>   “La frontera esta mas que sellada.” “Ya no vale<br>   la pena.” These are the phrases   that stick with<br>   me as we are led out of the director’s office into<br>   the patio where about 10 of the migrant men<br>   are sitting.

By studying Medieval   courtly love, contrasting Victorian heroines to their Byronic heroes, and   investigating the legacy of 2nd wave feminism as it has been accepted or   rejected in recent YA fiction, the common thread among these different   literatures proves itself to be a study of &#39;the female&#39; as she has been   perceived and portrayed in terms of traditional, patriarchal, and   heteronormative definitions of maleness. The female as not-male, possessing   no inherent identity that can be separated from the absence of masculinity,   is a societal paradigm that female authors from Marie de France to Stephenie   Meyer have grappled with, each author a study of her times and each female   protagonist a symbol of the work that remains to be done by scholars in terms   of redefining perceptions of women’s fiction.

Bayn al-Qasrayn, or   “Between the Two Palaces”, a former parading ground and major thoroughfare   initially constructed in 10th century Egypt, presents an intriguing example   of the re-use and reconfiguration of a public square in light of the dynastic   succession which occurs within the Egyptian capital between the 10th and the   13th centuries. The consideration of Bayn al-Qasrayn as “public”, therefore,   is vastly affected by the issues of political ideology and the importance of   political ceremony to the imperial elite.

By studying Medieval   courtly love, contrasting Victorian heroines to their Byronic heroes, and   investigating the legacy of 2nd wave feminism as it has been accepted or   rejected in recent YA fiction, the common thread among these different   literatures proves itself to be a study of &#39;the female&#39; as she has been   perceived and portrayed in terms of traditional, patriarchal, and   heteronormative definitions of maleness. The female as not-male, possessing   no inherent identity that can be separated from the absence of masculinity,   is a societal paradigm that female authors from Marie de France to Stephenie   Meyer have grappled with, each author a study of her times and each female   protagonist a symbol of the work that remains to be done by scholars in terms   of redefining perceptions of women’s fiction. (Research supported by the   Mellon Mays Undergraduate Fellowship) <br>   <br>   Michelle Al-Ferzly ’14, Art History<br>   Advisor: Lamia Balafrej, Art<br>   Title: The Re-Use of Public Space in Medieval Cairo<br>   This inquiry focuses on the ways in which public space is understood   in the context of the medieval Islamic city, Cairo. Bayn al-Qasrayn, or   “Between the Two Palaces”, a former parading ground and major thoroughfare   initially constructed in 10th century Egypt, presents an intriguing example   of the re-use and reconfiguration of a public square in light of the dynastic   succession which occurs within the Egyptian capital between the 10th and the   13th centuries. The consideration of Bayn al-Qasrayn as “public”, therefore,   is vastly affected by the issues of political ideology and the importance of   political ceremony to the imperial elite.

These represent complex networks of causal   factors, which have developed over long time spans.  Yet, historical   records and modern instrumental data that can help us understand   environmental and climatic change typically extend at most only a few   centuries backwards in time.  Here, we use data from archaeological   contexts to model and understand long-term socio-environmental impacts and   responses to climate change.  We explore the cumulative effects of land   use, industrial activities, and natural resource exploitation on modern   ecosystem functioning, health, and climatic patterns.  We test paradigms   that help explain socio-ecological interactions, and evaluate these against   archaeological and modeled systems.  This work helps us understand the   development of environmental systems dominated by anthropogenic   agency—resulting in the Anthropocene period of global change.  ",

    "description": "Human   rights work tends to be viewed as overwhelmingly good—linked to global   development and the protection of vulnerable human beings from depravity,   illness, and suffering.

Since the 1978 reform movements in China, the concept of what   Adam Smith called  “the invisible hand” has gained widespread acceptance   in Chinese society.  Yet, this acceptance varies by generation. The   generation born during The Cultural Revolution was nurtured by a planned   economy where consumer values were widely based on the presence of a strong   interventionist state that provided extensive welfare benefits.  The   motivations for their economic choices differ significantly from more   libertarian principles that underlay the historical development of Western   capitalist economies. This presentation focuses on the generational   differences in attitudes toward the free market and their consequences for   the future development of Chinese society.  Can these generational   differences be resolved as China increasingly turns toward a more open   economy? How will such differences affect future political developments?",

The study examined the influence of acculturation and   perceived sociocultural pressure on body esteem and body dissatisfaction   among 213 undergraduate women of Asian, Asian American, Caucasian,   Hispanic/Latina, and Black descent. Data was gathered through an   online survey and results indicated that acculturation into American   society along with sociocultural pressure affect the body images of women   differently depending on their ethnicity. As acculturation increased, Asian   American women experienced lower rates of body dissatisfaction whereas Asian   women reported lower overall body esteem. Additionally, Hispanic/Latina women   had the highest levels of body dissatisfaction compared to women of other   ethnicities.

We hypothesized   that helicopter parenting would correlate positively with anxiety and   depression and negatively with self-esteem, autonomy, and competence. We   further hypothesized that students of Asian descent would experience the   highest levels of helicopter parenting compared to other racial groups, and   that parental maladaptive covert narcissism would be a significant predictor   of helicopter parenting. Correlational data analyses revealed that mothers   demonstrated significantly higher levels of helicopter parenting than   fathers. Mothers’ helicopter parenting behaviors were related to increased   depressive symptoms and decreased self-esteem, autonomy, and competence in   students. Fathers’ helicopter parenting behaviors were associated with   decreased self-esteem and autonomy. The findings provide insight into the   negative outcomes related to helicopter parenting and can help academic   institutions protect the mental health of students transitioning through   their college years.",

The study examined the influence of acculturation and   perceived sociocultural pressure on body esteem and body dissatisfaction   among 213 undergraduate women of Asian, Asian American, Caucasian,   Hispanic/Latina, and Black descent. Data was gathered through an   online survey and results indicated that acculturation into American   society along with sociocultural pressure affect the body images of women   differently depending on their ethnicity. As acculturation increased, Asian   American women experienced lower rates of body dissatisfaction whereas Asian   women reported lower overall body esteem. Additionally, Hispanic/Latina women   had the highest levels of body dissatisfaction compared to women of other   ethnicities.

Older community members were recruited to partner   with students in a series of discovery, design, and community-building   activities. Come hear Babson and Olin students present results of the   empathetic design process. During the semester, students and their elder   partners engaged in activities designed to create community and   understanding. Next, students synthesized what they learned into project   ideas, refining briefs into robust, targeted, and manageable projects through   consultation with experts and co-design with elder partners. A series of   standard design stages -- specification, prototyping, testing, refinement --   was accompanied by visits with partners for feedback and continued learning   and community building. Shortly after the Ruhlman conference, partners will   receive custom-designed artifacts intended to solve particular problems.

Older community members were recruited to partner   with students in a series of discovery, design, and community-building   activities. Come hear Babson and Olin students present results of the   empathetic design process. During the semester, students and their elder   partners engaged in activities designed to create community and   understanding. Next, students synthesized what they learned into project   ideas, refining briefs into robust, targeted, and manageable projects through   consultation with experts and co-design with elder partners. A series of   standard design stages -- specification, prototyping, testing, refinement --   was accompanied by visits with partners for feedback and continued learning   and community building. Shortly after the Ruhlman conference, partners will   receive custom-designed artifacts intended to solve particular problems.

While we are in agreement that being able to freely share one’s views and   ideas is important to a functioning democracy, what happens when this freedom   results in a “tyranny of the majority”?  This is what has happened in   the media representation of the Republican Party. It has been misrepresented   by the media, especially in the last two Presidential elections, and   especially among American youth. We examine the ways in which the Republican   Party has been misrepresented and the social stigmatization of those who   consider themselves Republicans.  The topics of the panel include: the   Republican Party and the youth generation; media bias and its effects on   audiences; and the effects of misrepresentation on minority voting   patterns.   Panelists will present strategies for countering   negative stereotypes and strategies for increasing Republican Party   participation youth, minorities and in the media.",

    "textsearch": "Perspectives from the   Freedom Project III: A Misrepresented Political Minority: The Republican   Party As   Adam Smith Fellows of The Freedom Project, we have discussed the importance   of liberty in human societies, particularly in terms of freedom of speech.   While we are in agreement that being able to freely share one’s views and   ideas is important to a functioning democracy, what happens when this freedom   results in a “tyranny of the majority”?  This is what has happened in   the media representation of the Republican Party. It has been misrepresented   by the media, especially in the last two Presidential elections, and   especially among American youth. We examine the ways in which the Republican   Party has been misrepresented and the social stigmatization of those who   consider themselves Republicans.  The topics of the panel include: the   Republican Party and the youth generation; media bias and its effects on   audiences; and the effects of misrepresentation on minority voting   patterns.   Panelists will present strategies for countering   negative stereotypes and strategies for increasing Republican Party   participation youth, minorities and in the media. 11:00am 12:10pm SCI-396 174  Lizamarie Arias 2017 Undeclared Anna Page 2017    Undeclared Alexis Zhang 2017  Undeclared "

    "description": "Over   the summer I interned in the fashion department of Redbook Magazine of the   Hearst Corporation. There I worked both in the Fashion closet assisting with   “stories” and on the website, creating online “flipbooks” such as trending   swimwear, summer dresses, handbags, and fall boots.  During my many projects one of the things   that kept coming up was how difficult it was for women to find the right   clothing size for them and that in fact many women wear the wrong size   without even realizing it. To highlight this, in the October issue of Redbook   we worked on a &quot;best fit denim story.&quot; We had 20 women come to the   office for a &quot;Denim Bar party&quot; to help them find a good pair of   jeans. We assembled 600 pairs of jeans from 20 different brands in sizes   00-24. Even in this situation with so many different sizes and brands   available it was difficult for the women to find even two pairs of jeans that   fit them well.  Based on this   experience, I decided to design and create a mobile phone app to help women   find their right size in different brands. It will run on the android   platform. The user is asked to take three measurements of her body (bust,   waist, hips) and enter them in the app. Based on these measurements and the   sizing information provided by clothing companies, the program decides the   right size for her in different clothing brands, and presents the results.   The app also gives her the option of setting up an account, where her data   will be stored. She can use her login credentials to access that information   any time in the future. In order to make this app, I had to introduce myself   to and learn how to use MIT’s app inventor. In the next few months I plan   to extend my application by incorporating source crowding. My plan is to use   the working version of this app with Wellesley women, part of the intended   audience, to verify my algorithms and the results they produce. In addition   this might prove to be an alternative way of deciding one’s size in different   brands, without even the need for taking one’s measurements.  This would   make for a much more user-friendly app. My hope is that this application will   make it just a bit easier and faster for women to find clothes that fit them   better.",

    "textsearch": "The Right Fit   App<br>   <br>   Find Out What Size You are in Different Brands! Over   the summer I interned in the fashion department of Redbook Magazine of the   Hearst Corporation. There I worked both in the Fashion closet assisting with   “stories” and on the website, creating online “flipbooks” such as trending   swimwear, summer dresses, handbags, and fall boots.  During my many projects one of the things   that kept coming up was how difficult it was for women to find the right   clothing size for them and that in fact many women wear the wrong size   without even realizing it. To highlight this, in the October issue of Redbook   we worked on a &quot;best fit denim story.&quot; We had 20 women come to the   office for a &quot;Denim Bar party&quot; to help them find a good pair of   jeans. We assembled 600 pairs of jeans from 20 different brands in sizes   00-24. Even in this situation with so many different sizes and brands   available it was difficult for the women to find even two pairs of jeans that   fit them well.  Based on this   experience, I decided to design and create a mobile phone app to help women   find their right size in different brands. It will run on the android   platform. The user is asked to take three measurements of her body (bust,   waist, hips) and enter them in the app. Based on these measurements and the   sizing information provided by clothing companies, the program decides the   right size for her in different clothing brands, and presents the results.   The app also gives her the option of setting up an account, where her data   will be stored. She can use her login credentials to access that information   any time in the future. In order to make this app, I had to introduce myself   to and learn how to use MIT’s app inventor. In the next few months I plan   to extend my application by incorporating source crowding. My plan is to use   the working version of this app with Wellesley women, part of the intended   audience, to verify my algorithms and the results they produce. In addition   this might prove to be an alternative way of deciding one’s size in different   brands, without even the need for taking one’s measurements.  This would   make for a much more user-friendly app. My hope is that this application will   make it just a bit easier and faster for women to find clothes that fit them   better. 3:00pm 4:10pm PNE-239 9  Sophia A.
