// V2.0 by Scott D. Anderson

/*

 Description: This is a simplified version of the whole taskmin app that I
 built in the summer and fall of 2016. This is the final project for the
 Spring of 2017, the first time the course was offered.

 You can add/remove tasks, and mark them as completed.  Any change can be
 undone. Confirmation by doing something else. You can mark tasks as work
 or personal. Students are welcome to change the categories, but don't
 have to allow users to do so.

 Tasks have the following attributes:


// A Task Administration app using JavaScript and LocalStorage. 

/* Design for V1.0

   The app manages a list of tasks -- a "to do" list.

   At the top of the app are several buttons:

   one allows the user to add a task by opening up a form to enter (1)
   text, (2) priority, (3) a deadline, and (4) a tag. Each tag affects the
   background color.

   A third button allows the user to sort the tasks by priority, tags, or
   duedate.

   Each task has the following properties:

1. text, describing the task
1. priority, default is "medium"
1. duedate: a parseable date string
1. tag: one of the possible built-in tags
