<p>This is an example solution to a new assignment in which data is read
  from a static .json file and processed in the browser to create a
  display of all the data. I'm allowing a lot of latitude in the display,
  and here I've shown one option (I plan to add another).  A successful solution must do the
  following:
  <ul>
    <li>Display all the talks in a <q>compact</q> form. Here, the compact
    form has the title, authors, start time and location.
      
    <li>Clicking on a compact display yields a detailed display that
    includes the abstract.  (You can add other data as well.)  Here, I did
    it as a lightbox-like overlay.
      
    <li>Clicking on the detailed display returns to the compact display.
  </ul>

        <p>While   routine vaccination has helped raise juvenile life expectancy and eradicate   diseases, vaccine delivery systems have not capitalized on our current   understanding of the adaptive immune response. Recently identified toll-like   receptors (TLRs) provide promising targets for novel vaccine delivery;   however, free adjuvant can trigger systemic toxicity. We hypothesize that   nanoparticles engineered to deliver a TLR agonist and antigen in a   controlled-release manner to antigen-presenting cells (APC) can utilize TLR   targets for immunostimulation at a reduced risk. Our vaccines augment antigen   presentation and co-stimulatory DC molecule production for model protein   ovalbumin and mount an antigen-specific CD8+ na√Øve cell-proliferation in   vitro. In vivo, our vaccines increase the antigen-specific adaptive immune   response for both the cell-mediated and humoral branches. Our findings   demonstrate clinical potential for safe delivery of novel TLR adjuvants and   polymeric nanoparticles towards the development of effective and low-cost   vaccines.",
