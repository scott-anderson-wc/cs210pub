<H1>A History of Computing through Representation</H1>

<H2>What is a computer?</H2>

<P>A calculating device that can follow detailed instructions.

<P>Note that this definition does not restrict computers to the digital
devices we use these days.  Computers weren't always digital, and they may
not be digital in the future.

<P>To use a computer one needs a way to represent <strong>data</strong> (such as
numbers, letters, and/or other symbols), <strong>operations</strong> (such as
addition and multiplication to manipulate data), and
<strong>instructions</strong> (to describe a sequence of operations).

<p>Of course, modern computers manipulate other objects such as
images, movies, animations, sound, too.  We'll be looking at these
later in the course.

<HR>

<H2>Representations so far...</H2>

<P>People have used a variety of materials over the years for these
representations. In a sense, the history of computing is a history of
representations.

<P>This is only a partial history of computing devices. The emphasis here
is on innovative representations, not in a complete set of computing
devices developed over the years. For a more complete history of computing
devices, you should check <A HREF="http://www.pbs.org/nerds/timeline/">the
PBS documentary.</A> There is a more detailed set of <A

computing devices</A> that you can access from the IEEE Computer Society.

<H2>Small is Fast</H2>

innovation on representation. <STRONG><A

<A HREF="http://www.pbs.org/nerds/timeline/micro.html"> smaller is

<H2>The Future</H2>

<P>What will the Future 5th Generation look like?

<p>One thing is certain, that there is a human desire for the highest
computational power possible. But it is not clear today how faster
machines will be developped. We understand that we cannot keep on creating
faster <strong>uni-processor</strong> computers. We need some kind of
<strong>multi-processor</strong> computers. Today, you can buy a computer
with two or four processors that work in parallel.

<p>What will the future's <strong>massively parallel computers</strong> be
like? Will they be...

<P>We do not know yet. Maybe all of the above. Maybe something more
exotic. In any case we expect it to be at least as surprising and exciting
it has been so far.

<HR>

<H2>The Bottom Line</H2>

<P>It has all been a matter of representation. That was the real innovation throughout time.

<P><strong>Technological innovation</strong> is our ability to match
seemingly unrelated objects and ideas in order to produce something
better. We will see that again and again in this course.
