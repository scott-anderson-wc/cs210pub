          <h2 id="selectors">CSS Selectors</h2>

          <p>When we introduced <a href="CSS1.html">CSS rules</a>, we described 
            the generic form of a rule as in
          Figure 1. At the head of the rule is the selector, followed by a series of 
          property and values pairs enclosed in curly braces.</p>
                  
          <figure class="text-center">
            <img src="css-selectors-files/css_rule.png" alt="depiction of a css rule"
                 class="img-thumbnail">
            <figcaption>Figure 1: Depiction of a CSS Rule</figcaption>
          </figure>
          
          <p>Today's focus is on the <code>selector</code>. The selector
            indicates which element(s) the rule will apply to. So far, we
            have only seen a <em>tag</em> as the selector, so a rule would
            style all paragraphs (P elements), or all EM elements, or
            whatever elements correspond to that tag. In this reading, we
            will expand the set of selectors.</p>
            
          <h2 id="css_and_id">CSS and ID</h2>

          <p>Back in the reading on <a href="URLs.html">URLs</a>, we
          learned about giving an element an <em>ID</em> (short
          for <em>identifier</em>, like a driver's license is a kind
          of <q>ID card</q>).  Because an ID is <em>unique</em> on a web
          page, it can be the target of a hyperlink.  For example, the
          title of this section (see the H2 element just before this
          paragraph) has an ID of <code>css_and_id</code>, and so the
          relative URL for this section is
          <a href="css-selectors.html#css_and_id"><code>http://css-selectors.html#css_and_id</code></a>.
          (Try it!).

          <p>In addition, an ID can be used as the <em>selector</em> in a
          CSS rule.  Thus, the following rule was used to make that H2
          section header teal:
            <pre class="prettyprint lang-css"><code class="css">#css_and_id {
   color: teal;
}
</code></pre>

            <p>Notice the syntax here: the ID is preceded by
            a <code>#</code> symbol (pronounced <q>hash,</q> or <q>sharp
            sign,</q> or <q>pound sign</q>, depending on your awareness of
            twitter, your musical training and your age).

            <p>The ID selector picks out the element with that ID,
            and <em>only</em> that element, to apply the style to.  But
            what about the rule that sets all the H2 elements to light
            blue, namely this following?  (Later, we'll learn about
            the <code>#2EA9D3</code> code, but for now, trust us that it
            means light blue)
              
            <pre class="prettyprint lang-css"><code class="css">h2 {
   color: #2EA9D3;
}
</code></pre>
          
            <p>The conflict is resolved by using the
            more <em>specific</em> rule, which is the one with the
            ID. You're probably not surprised at that.

          <h2 id="css_and_classes">CSS and Classes</h2>

          <p>One drawback of using an ID is that an ID is unique, so you
          can only style one element using an ID. Suppose we have various
          elements on our page that are important, and we want to style
          them differently from non-important elements. We could number
          them <code>important1</code>, <code>important2</code>, and so
          on, but that would be unbearably tedious.  Instead, we want to
          describe a kind or category of element, which CSS calls
          a <em>class</em> of element.

          <p>An example will help. Suppose we have a grocery list. We're
          actually out of some critical items, so those have been given
          the class <code>important</code>:
            
            <ul>
              <li class="important">milk
              <li class="important">bread
              <li>apples
              <li>bananas
              <li class="important">toilet paper
              <li>soap
            </ul>

          <p>Here's the source code:
<pre class="prettyprint lang-html"><code class="html">&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li class="important"&gt;milk
    &lt;li class="important"&gt;bread
    &lt;li&gt;apples
    &lt;li&gt;bananas
    &lt;li class="important"&gt;toilet paper
    &lt;li&gt;soap
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>            

         <p>You can see that class works just like ID, in that you specify
         it as the value of an HTML attribute.  Note that, just like ID,
         you as the <em>author</em> of the web page get to decide what the
         ID or class is.  If you want to label them <code>critical</code>,
         or <code>crit</code> or whatever, that's your choice.

          <p>Now let's turn to the CSS side of things. The important items
          in the list above got styled using bold red using a CSS rule
          like this:
            
            <pre class="prettyprint lang-css"><code class="css">.important {
   color: red;
   font-weight: bold;
}
</code></pre>

          <p>First, note the syntax of the selector. The name of the class
          is preceded by a dot or a period (a <q>full stop</q> if you're
          British). Otherwise, it works just like an ID: all the elements
          with that class get that style rule applied.

            <h2>ID, Class, Abstraction and Modularity</h2>

          <p>In this discussion of ID and class, we can see the concepts
          of abstraction and modularity that we will return to many times
          in this course.  First of all, the ID and class allows us to
          separate the <em>structure</em> and <em>semantics</em> of the
          page (which belong to HTML) from the <em>presentation</em>
          or <em>style</em> of the page (which belong to CSS).  Separating
          different aspects is part of modularity. The name that we choose
          for the ID or class provides the semantic label, and the CSS
          rule then applies some style to those labelled element(s).

          <p>A related aspect of this modularity is how to choose the
          names. Suppose that instead of choosing <code>important</code>
          as the class name, we had chosen <code>bold_red</code>. It's
          about the same amount of typing, and it's much clearer as to
          what the class name does, right?  However, trouble arises when
          we change the site.  Suppose have a big website, with hundreds
          of pages and thousands of elements
          labeled <code>important</code>. Cleverly, you have one external
          CSS file that every page uses, so the CSS rule is just in one
          place, like this:

            <pre class="prettyprint lang-css"><code class="css">.boldred {
   color: red;
   font-weight: bold;
}
</code></pre>

          <p>One day, the boss comes in and
            says <q>I'm tired of the bold red; it's too scary. Change them
              all to medium maroon.</q> You change the rule as follows:
            <pre class="prettyprint lang-css"><code class="css">.boldred {
   color: maroon;
   font-weight: medium;
}
</code></pre>
            and you're done in five minutes, with all the hundreds of
            pages instantly getting the new rule. The boss thinks you're a
            wizard. This shows the power of modularity &mdash; in this case,
            specifying something in one place instead of copy/pasting.

          <p>However, you now have a website
          where <code>class="boldred"</code> changes the contents to
          medium maroon. At best, that's confusing and misleading.

          <p>The better approach is to name things by what
          they <em>mean</em> rather than by what they <em>do</em>. That's
          the power of <em>abstraction</em>.  It's not always possible to
          come up with a good name, but it's worth trying to.  You can
          read more
          about <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/goodclassnames">good
          class names</a>.
            
            <h2 id="id_vs_class">ID versus Class</h2>

<p>Students often wonder about what the difference is between
a <strong>class</strong> and an <strong>id</strong>, and when to use
each one.  The key is <em>uniqueness</em>: an id <em>must</em> be
unique, while a class describes a kind/type/category of element.

<p>For example, there might be <em>many</em> occurrences of
these <em>classes</em> of elements:
<ul>
<li>an external link, 
<li>a figure caption, 
<li>a logo graphic
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, there is probably only <em>one</em> of the following
elements per page, so these might have an <em>id</em>.

<ul>
<li>copyright statement
<li>login/logout box
<li>help button
</ul>

          <p>With ID and class as tools, we can create as
          many <q>hooks</q> for styling as we want. In principle, every
          single element could have its own ID, and we could give it a
          custom style. However, that would be tedious and
          confusing. There's a better way, which we turn to now.

          <h2 id="desc">Descendant Selectors</h2>

          <p>A <em>descendant selector</em> creates a style rule where the
          elements are chosen based on where they are in the hierarchy of
          the page. Remember that an HTML document can be modeled as a
          tree. At the root is the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element, with
          all other elements as descendants, grouped in different
          families. <a href="chrome-inspector.html"> Chrome's
          Inspect Element</a> gives a very good depiction of the tree
          corresponding to the document.

          <p>Let's start with a motivating example. By default, hyperlinks
          are blue and underlined. That might be what you want for most of
          your page, but in the nav bar you want them to be, say, green
          and not underlined. Here's one way:
            <pre class="prettyprint lang-html"><code class="html">&lt;nav&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="navlink" href="home.html"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="navlink" href="about.html"&gt;About Us&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="navlink" href="contact.html"&gt;Contact Info&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
</code></pre>

            <p>You can combine that with the following CSS rule:
              <pre class="prettyprint lang-css"><code class="css">.navlink {
    text-decoration: none;
    color: green;
    background-color: gray;
}
</code></pre>

            <p>That's not too bad, but supposing that you also want to
            adjust other elements inside the NAV (say removing the bullets
            from the UL), you'd have to add more IDs and classes. You can
            see that this is tedious and annoying. You really want to
            say <q>stuff inside the NAV is styled differently.</q> For
            that, we can use
            <em>descendant selectors</em>, meaning that all descendants of
            an element are selected.  (The UL is a child of the NAV, the
            LI elements are grandchildren, and the A elements are
            great-grandchildren.)  Here's an example:
              <pre class="prettyprint lang-css"><code class="css">nav ul {
    list-style-type: none;
}

nav a {
    text-decoration: none;
    color: green;
    background-color: gray;
}
</code></pre>

            <p>With a descendant selector, you give <em>two</em>
            selectors.  The first is the ancestor and the second is the
            descendant.  If you have <code>A B</code>, it means all
            elements that match <code>B</code> that are also descendants
            of elements that match <code>A</code>. (This can be
            generalized to three or more selectors, but that's uncommon.)

            <p>In the example above, we used two tags as the
            selectors, <code>NAV UL</code> and <code>NAV A</code>, but the
            selectors don't have to be tags. Either selector could be any
            one of the three basic selectors we know: (1) tags, (2) ID,
            and (3) class.  For example:
              
              <pre class="prettyprint lang-css"><code class="css">#banner H1 {
    font-size: xx-large;  /* banner header is huge */
}

#copyright em {
   font-style: normal;  /* italic looks weird in tiny font */                
}
                
.appendix h2 {
   color: blue; /* make headers in appendices look different */
}

.appendix .important {
   color: black;  /* since it's in an appendix, don't use red */             
}
</code></pre>                

            <p>In practice, you wouldn't use an ID as the second selector,
            since an ID is already unique and doesn't gain any specificity
            by adding an ancestor.

            <p>To use descendant selectors effectively, it's important to
            keep the tree in your mind. Here is a graphic of a tree from
            an example you've seen before:

          <figure class="text-center">
            <img src="css-selectors-files/tree.png" alt="depiction of the DOM tree"
                 class="img-thumbnail">
            <figcaption>Figure 2: Depiction of a Tree</figcaption>
          </figure>
          
          <p>Since the ancestry of an element is important with descendant
          selectors, debugging can require being able to easily see the
          ancestry of a particular element. Figure 3 shows the path of
          elements in which our <code>a</code> element is nested, as
          displayed by Chrome's Inspect Element window. This is an
          absolute path, starting from the root, <code>html</code>. When
          we specify the selector, we can use only parts of such a path,
          such as <code>nav ul li a</code>, or simply <code>nav
          a</code>.</p>
          
          <figure class="text-center">
            <img src="css-selectors-files/nesting.png" alt="depiction of the DOM tree to show nesting elements"
                 class="img-thumbnail">
            <figcaption>Figure 3: Nested elements path as depicted in Inspect Element window.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          
          <h2 id="pseudo">Pseudo-selectors</h2>

          <p>There is one more kind of selector that will be important in
          CS 110, namely <em>pseudo-selectors</em>. We will look at how to
          format <em>hyperlinks</em>.  As you know, hyperlinks are blue by
          default, but only when they haven't been visited. Once you've
          visited them, they turn purple (by default).  You can control
          the style of both kind of link using CSS. You can also control
          what they look like when you hover over them, and in the moment
          of clicking on them. There are names for these four
          states:
            <ul>
              <li><code>a:link</code> is an unvisited link
              <li><code>a:visited</code> is, unsurprisingly, a visited link
              <li><code>a:hover</code> is when the mouse is over the link
              <li><code>a:active</code> is the moment when the link is clicked 
            </ul>

          <p>Here's an example of some CSS to style all four states:
            
              <pre class="prettyprint lang-css"><code class="css">#hyperlink-example a:link {
    color: orange;
}                
                
#hyperlink-example a:visited {
    color: red;
}                
                
#hyperlink-example a:hover {
    border: 1px solid blue;
    font-size: 2em;                
}
                
#hyperlink-example a:active {
    border: 2px solid red;
    font-size: 2em;                
    font-weight: bold;                
}
</code></pre>                

          <p>Here's the example in action:
            <div id="hyperlink-example">
              <ul>
                <li><a href="http://news.google.com">Google News</a>
                <li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk">The BBC</a>
                <li><a href="http://www.nytimes.com">The NY Times</a>
              </ul>
            </div>

          <p>Note that there are ordering constraints among these
            pseudo-selector rules; we recommend specifying them in the
            order used above. You don't have to specify all of them
            (<code>:active</code>, for example, is pretty rare, and with
            touch screen devices, <code>:hover</code> is useless).

          <p>You can learn more and play with the specifications using
          this
          page: <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_link.asp">W3
          Schools CSS Links</a>.

            <p>Note that if you don't care about the state of the link,
              you can specify the appearance just using the <code>A</code>
              tag:
              
              <pre class="prettyprint lang-css"><code class="css">#hyperlink-stateless a {
    color: green;
}                
</code></pre>                

          <p>Here's the stateless example in action:
            <div id="hyperlink-stateless">
              <ul>
                <li><a href="http://www.latimes.com">The LA Times</a>
                <li><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com">The Washington
                Post</a>
              </ul>
            </div>


            <h2>Selector Summary</h2>

            <p>Let's summarize the kinds of selectors that we've learned:
              
            <ul>
              <li><em>tag</em> , e.g., <code>p</code>, <code>em</code>, <code>li</code>, etc. Such
              a selector will apply to <strong>all</strong> elements of this kind in the document.</li>

              <li><em>.classname</em>, e.g., <code>.important</code>. 
              Such a selector will apply to all elements that share the attribute 
                <code>class=classname</code>.</li>

              <li><em>tag.classname</em>, e.g, <code>h2.important</code>. Such a selector will apply
                to the indicated elements with the
                attribute <code>class=classname</code>. We didn't learn
                this explicitly, but it's a straightforward variation on
                the classname idea.</li>

              <li><em>#idName</em>, e.g., <code>#main</code>, etc. Such a selector applies to the
              <strong>single</strong> element that has the attribute <code>id=idName</code>.</li>  

              <li><em>selector descendant-selector</em>, e.g. <code>nav
              a</code>.  This applies to all descendants of the selected
              kind that have the selected ancestor.

              <li><em>a:link</em>, <em>a:visited</em>, <em>a:hover</em>
              and <em>a:active</em>. These pseudo-selectors allow you to
              style hyperlinks based on their state.

           </ul>


          <p>To better understand the different kinds of CSS selectors, refer to the code examples in 
            <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp">W3Schools CSS Selectors</a>'
          page.</p>
          

<h2 class="line">More Selectors</h2>

<p>There are many more esoteric selectors, and you're welcome to learn
  them. The following material is <em>optional</em>, and you can stop
  here.  Read on if you're curious.

<h2>Grouping Selectors</h2>

<p>If you have a rule that you want to apply to several things, rather
  than copy/paste the rule (copy/paste is <em>always</em> bad for
  modularity), you can share the rule.  Suppose you have three elements on
  the page with IDs of <code>harry</code>, <code>ron</code>,
  and <code>hermione</code>. If they all have different colors, but the
  same font, you could do:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-css"><code class="css">#harry { color: red; }
#ron { color: green; }                
#hermione { color: blue; }                

#harry, #ron, #hermione {
   font-family: impact;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that there's just one rule to specify the font family for
  all three.  All you have to do is list all the selectors, separated by
  commas. The selectors can be tags, classes, ids, even descendant
  selectors, in any order.

<h2>More Pseudo-Selectors</h2>

<p>Pseudo-selectors come in two flavors: pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>A pseudo-class</strong> differentiates among an element’s different 
              states or types. Examples of using <em>states</em> of an element are: 
              information about link states: <code>:hover</code>, <code>:visited</code>, 
              <code>:active</code>, about form inputs states: <code>:checked</code>, 
            <code>:disabled</code>. Examples of using the <em>type</em> of an element are structural
            pseudo-classes such as 
              <code>:first-child</code> [see <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_sel_firstchild">example</a>], 
              <code>:nth-child(odd)</code>
              [see <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss3_nth-child_odd_even">example</a>], 
              <code>:nth-of-type(n)</code> [see <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss3_nth-of-type">example</a>]. Finally, in CSS3, there is a new pseudo-class known as <code>:not</code>,
              which negates a rule for the selected element (that is, the rule will apply to
              all other elements that are not selected). See <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss3_not">example</a>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>A pseudo-element</strong> provides access to an element’s subpart, 
            which includes those pseudo-elements that select portions of text nodes, 
            for instance, <code>:first-line</code> 
              [see <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_firstline">example</a>]
              or <code>:first-letter</code> [see <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_sel_firstletter">example</a>].</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>In CSS3, to differentitate between pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements, the syntax 
          to refer to them has changed. An element is referred with a double colon. You will see
          both examples on the Web, because they are still supported by browsers. Two new 
          pseudo-elements that are also interesting are <code>::before</code> and 
          <code>::after</code> which can be used to add content before or after an element. These 
          are used when one wants to add icons in front or after certain elements, see 
            <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_before">example</a>.</p>
