# Code Anywhere

[CodeAnywhere](https://codeanywhere.com/) is a web-based service that
allows you to create virtual machines (workspaces) and Integrated
Development Environments (IDEs) that are based in the cloud. We'll be
using it at the "starter" level, which, with an educational discount, the
department can afford.

## Accounts

I will send each student in the course an invitation using their Wellesley
email address. You will have to confirm that, and you should then be able
to create a container. We'll do all this in class.  Just save the email
and have it ready in class.
