# Chapter 5 Supplement

This reading summarizes and expands on the concepts of adaptive layouts
with media queries that we learned in chapter 5.

## Summary

* standard term is *responsive* though I agree with their objection
* viewports:
    * layout viewport: what the developer uses for layout
    * visual viewport: what the user sees
* often the visual viewport is narrower than the layout viewport, requiring
    * zooming out
    * scrolling
* set the layout viewport with this:

```
:::HTML
<meta name="viewport"
      content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

* media queries using (in CSS) like this:

```
:::CSS
@media all and (min-width: 768px) {
    selector {
        flex-direction: row;
    }
    /* other CSS rules */
}
```

* setting print styles:

```
:::CSS
@media print {
    body {
        /* Note "pt" (points) not "px" (pixels).
           72.27pt = 1 inch */
        font-size: 12pt "Times New Roman";
    }
    /* other CSS rules */
}
```

## Media Queries

A media query, like all CSS rules, *overrides* earlier rules. So, the
question is, what is the *default*: the large device or the small device?

Given the primacy of mobile nowadays, it's better to design for *small*
and later make use of *larger* devices.

Therefore use `min-width`:

```
:::CSS
@media all and (min-width: NNNpx) {
    /* rules for large devices */
}
```

rather than `max-width`:

```
:::CSS
@media all and (max-width: NNNpx) {
    /* rules for smaller devices */
}
```

## Breakpoints

What widths make sense to use to call in a different layout?  Common
values are:

* 320px smartphones
* 786px tablets
* 1024px laptops and desktops

These are called *breakpoints* where you switch from one layout to
another.  See [Media Queries for Common Device
Breakpoints](https://responsivedesign.is/develop/browser-feature-support/media-queries-for-common-device-breakpoints)

Of course, those values aren't cast in stone. New devices and pixel
densities are always coming out.
