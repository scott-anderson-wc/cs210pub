# Chapter 4 Supplement

This reading summarizes and expands on the concepts of responsive and
flexible layouts that we learned in chapter 4.

## Mobile First

We should first design our websites so that they work effectively on small
devices, and only later take advantage of greater space.  Some rules of thumb:

* don't lay things out horizontally; stack things vertically
* give images CSS declarations like `width:100%` so that they scale to smaller displays
* don't use table elements and such that might be wider than the display
* specify widths in percentages when feasible
* don't specify widths of elements in pixels (or, at least, wide widths) which might
result in the dreaded horizontal scrolling

## inline-blocks

In the last chapter, we learned about *inline* elements, like `span`, that
are found in running text and would move around as the browser gets wider
and narrower.

We also learned about *block* elements, which use the box model, can
(typically) contain other block elements, and stack vertically on the
page.

We now know about *inline block* elements, achieved with
`display:inline-block`. Such elements act like inline elements in terms of
filling out the width of their container (moving other inline elements up
from the next line until there's no more space), but they act like block
elements in that they can contain other block elements.

Note that the default width of a block or inline-block element is `100%`,
which means that there is never any room left to bring another one up from
the next line. So, it only makes sense to use inline-block where you are
setting the width (or it's a replaced element, like an `img`, and so the
width is derived from the contents).  Like this:

```
:::CSS
selector {
    display: inline-block;
    width: 20%;  /* five on a line */
    ...
}
```

## New HTML

* [main](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_main.asp) The main content of a page. Bigger than an article
* [div](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_div.asp) A meaningless block container. Useful for structuring the page

## Flexbox

With Flexbox, there is

* a *container* that is limited in size. Presumably takes the whole screen or a portion thereof. Contrast that with a Wikipedia page that is as long as it needs to be
* a set of *flex-items* to be displayed, all children of the container. This is automatic.
* a *direction* or *main axis* that the children will be oriented in (horizontally or vertically)
* a *cross axis* that is perpendicular to the *main axis*
* a specification for what happens with any leftover space in the flex container

Flex containers can be nested, so you have have rows with columns, columns
within rows, even rows within rows and columns within columns.

Flex items can grow and shrink. We learned two uses of the `flex` shorthand property:

* `flex: 0 1 auto` means don't grow me, shrink me if needed, and calculate my size from my contents
* `flex: 1 1 auto` means grow me as much as possible, shrink me if needed, and calculate my size from my contents


## New CSS Properties

Pretty much all of these are related to the new flexbox layout

* [align-items](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_align-items.asp) aligning (e.g. centering or stretching) flex-items
* [display:flex](http://www.w3schools.com/CSSref/pr_class_display.asp) to specify an element as a flex container
* [flex](http://www.w3schools.com/CSSref/css3_pr_flex.asp) how a flex item shrinks or grows
* [flex-direction](http://www.w3schools.com/CSSref/css3_pr_flex-direction.asp) row or column
* [justify-content](http://www.w3schools.com/CSSref/css3_pr_justify-content.asp) what happens with leftover space in a flex container?
* [overflow](http://www.w3schools.com/CSSref/pr_pos_overflow.asp) set what happens when an element's
contents is bigger than it is. Scroll? Hide? Show?
* [order](http://www.w3schools.com/CSSref/css3_pr_order.asp) what order does this flexitem go in? source order? after others? before others?
contents is bigger than it is. Scroll? Hide? Show?
* [text-shadow](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text-shadow.asp) can add a shadow to some text by reprinting the text in a different color and a small displacement
* [white-space](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_white-space.asp) what happens with white space in an element: normal? nowrap? 

## Absolute and Relative Positioning

Normally, we let the browser figure out where an element should land on the page, based on its size, the size of the container, whether it's a block or inline element, and so forth. This is because the default value of the `position` CSS property is `static`.  It has two other interesting values:

* `position:relative` which allows you to shift the element from its static position
* `position:absolute` which allows you to place the element within a Cartesian coordinate system

<div>
<style scoped>
.up_and_right {
    position: relative;
    top: -1em;
    left: 2em;
    color:red;
}
</style>

Here's a sentence in which a single red <span
class="up_and_right">word</span> has been moved from its usual place.
</div>

Here's how that's done. First, the CSS:

```
:::CSS
.up_and_right {
    position: relative;
    top: -1em;
    left: 2em;
    color:red;
}
```

Here's the HTML:

```
:::HTML
Here's a sentence in which a single red
<span class="up_and_right">word</span>
has been moved from its usual place.
```

In general:

* The element is shifted vertically using either `top` or `bottom` and
giving a signed distance by which to move the top or bottom of the
element.
* It's shifted horizontally using either `left` or `right` and
another signed distance.
* The starting location is where it would have
been if it had been `position:static` rather than `position:relative`.
* Note that other elements don't move as a result of the movement of this
one. (There's a gap left in the sentence above, where the word was moved from.)

Position absolute is similar, except that the distances are measured not
from the element's static position but in an absolute coordinate system,
where the origin of the system is *the first non-static ancestor* and if
no non-static ancestor is found, the browser window.

Therefore, *another* use of `position:relative` is to set the coordinate
system for its descendants.  I like to think of this as "my descendants
are positioned relative to *me*". Here's an example:

<div style="margin:10%;height:200px;position:relative;border:3px solid green;background-color:silver">
<div style="position:absolute;top:30px;left:50px;width:75px;height:75px;background-color:rgba(100%,80%,80%,0.8)">pink child</div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:-10px;left:-20px;width:75px;height:75px;background-color:rgba(80%,100%,80%,0.8)">green child</div>
<div style="position:absolute;bottom:20px;right:30px;width:75px;height:75px;background-color:rgba(80%,80%,100%,0.8)">blue child</div>
</div>

This is done by:

* putting `position:relative` on the ancestor (here the box with gray background)
* putting `position:absolute; top:30px; left:50px` on the pink child
* putting `position:absolute; top:-10px; left:-20px` on the green child
* putting `position:absolute; bottom:20px; right:30px` on the blue child

Use this feature sparingly. Sites where everything is positioned in
absolute coordinates are incredibly inflexible. You want a site that is
responsive to the size of the browser. Nevertheless, sometimes position
absolute can sometimes be useful.

Note that with `position:static`, elements can never overlap. In
particular, text can't overlap. But with `position:absolute` and
`position:relative` you can do that, if you want.

## Flexbox versus Float

Flexbox is relatively new (circa 2014, though proposals go all the way
back to 2009). Prior to widespread support for flexbox, web developers
used float, which still has some useful features and is still worth
knowing about.

Here's a simple example of float, where we get the text to wrap around an
image:

<div style="border:1px solid black;margin:1em;background-color:#eee">
<p style="width:80%"><img style="width:50%;float:left;margin-right:2em" src="../images/hermione-granger-thumb.jpeg"
alt="Hermione Granger"> Hermione Granger was indispensable in the Harry
Potter series. Harry had the title role, and he was clearly critical to
the story, but he did not have exceptional magical skill. His nemesis,
Lord Voldemort, was an extraordinary wizard, matched only by
Dumbledore. Harry, was good, but no more than good. Hermione, on the other
hand, was "the brightest witch of her age" according to Remus Lupin. There
was no spell she couldn't do, and her cleverness and foresight saved Harry
countless times.
</div>

Float causes the floated elements to be

1. Removed from the *flow*, so that later stuff moves up on the page, and
1. shoved back into the page, causing *block* elements to overlap it and
*inline* elements to wrap around it.

The example above shows the idea. Hermione's picture is floated (to the
left in this case) and the paragraph text (inline elements) flows around
it. 

## Centering Block Elements and Text

People love centering, particularly novice designers. Centering moves
things away from the edges, which makes it feel more comfortable, without
having to decide how much to move it. But there are two kinds of
centering. There's centering *block* elements and centering inline
elements like *text*.  Let's start with centering text:

## Centering Text

Centering text is pretty easy: just specify `text-align:center` on its
*parent* element (or, in general, some ancestor, since the setting is
inherited.)

You should almost never center lines of text in a paragraph.  You get
ragged edges left and right, which looks ugly.  Also, depending on the
font, amount of text and the width of the region, the last line may be
weirdly short (and centered).  Here's a <a
href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/27745.html">Tolkien quote</a>:

<div style="margin:10px;border:1px solid black;padding:10px;width:480px;font:15px arial;text-align:center">
  Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle and quick
  to anger.
</div>

You probably don't want that single word centered on the second line.  But
that can happen (and all-too-often does) when you center text and don't
have complete control over browser-width, font-size, and the like.

Instead, what you probably want is to have normal, left-aligned text in a
box that is itself centered.  Let's see how to center boxes.

## Centering Blocks

Here's an example of a block element (blue background) centered within its
container (red border):

<div style="border:1px solid red"><div style="background-color:#ccccff;width:80%;padding:10px;margin:10px auto">
  Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle and quick
  to anger.
</div></div>

Note that, by default, block elements are `width:100%` which means that
they are as wide as their container will let them be.  So, by default,
centering is not possible, because there's no extra space to center
within.  Therefore, to center a block element, you usually have to set its
width to something smaller than its normal width. The blue block above is
80% of its container.  One exception is IMG elements, since they get their
width from the actual image, not from the container.  However, pictures
are often quite wide, so you typically have to scale them down using a
`width` setting anyhow.

The trick to centering a block element is to set its `margin-left` and
`margin-right` to `auto`.  Auto margins means to take whatever space is
leftover in the container and distribute it equally to the two margins.

The example above used a shorthand: `margin:10px auto` which means the top
and bottom margins are 10px and the left and right are `auto`.

## Galleries with Floating Elements

We often want galleries of elements, where there should be as many on a
line as will fit, but fewer if necessary, without any horizontal
scrolling.  One way to do that is by setting `display:inline-block` and
set the width on the gallery elements, which allows you to put arbitrary
content in each element, while still having them fill the line like inline
elements.

Another way is to use `float:left` as shown by [W3schools
Gallery](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_gallery.asp)
