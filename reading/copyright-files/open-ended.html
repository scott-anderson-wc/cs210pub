<li>Recently, Pinterest has become a popular website for sharing things the user is interested in, but they've come under fire for copyright issues.

<li>copyright AND plagiarism - how prevalent does something have to be on the web for it to be considered common knowledge?

<li>Mark Zuckerberg and the invention of Facebook:  did he "take" the idea from the Harvard twins? 

<li>Music/lyric plagiarism

<li>"I know the European anti-piracy protests were a while ago, but I remember this stood out to me because of the way the author uses the way we experience the web now (as a shared external memory) to justify even greater freedom of information.

<li>When does parody infringe on copyright? 

<li>Illegal distribution of music on the internet. 

<li>THE MUSIC INDUSTRY 

<li>Online fanfiction - is it a copyright infringement? 

<li>Pintrest and the freedom with which people can spread and share ideas without the original author receiving credit. 

<li>How does copyright and fair use apply to fanfiction and using material in other original fanworks?  What counts as a fanwork?

<li>Intellectual property concerning music/movies and piracy on the internet.

<li>I would be interested to talk more about Digital Rights Management and its intersection with free speech.

<li>What about cover songs done by YouTubers? Some songs are taken down, while some songs are still online.

<li>We've been hearing a lot about new pieces of legislation to restrict
internet piracy like SOPA, PIPA, OPEN Act, etc. Can we talk a bit about
these kind of laws and how they will affect us if/when they're enacted?

<li>The fair use of personal information out on the web.

<li>How does copyright factor in when you borrow a book or other work (from a family member, friend, library, etc.)?  Wouldn’t enabling someone to borrow a book have a negative effect on its potential market since a person who borrows a book usually doesn’t buy a copy too?

<li>torrents and megaupload

<li>scanned and distributed books

<li>SOPA and PIPA

<li>I used to read (and, briefly, write) fanfiction online, which is where people write stories involving their favorite characters from various books, movies, tv shows etc. Does this violate copyright? I know a lot of people put disclaimers at the beginning of their stories (something along the lines of ""Harry Potter belongs to Warner Bros and JK Rowling and this story is not intended to make any money etc. etc."") Does this constitute fair use? "

<li>What are some preventative measures we can take to reduce cases of people accidentally infringing on someone else's property?  How can we make people more aware of the rules for fair use?  

<li>If a group is using the protected property to promote something good, how should people react?

<li>Copyright of artwork and weather or not this artwork, modified still belongs to the author. How much do you change a picture so that it becomes yours? 

<li>Definitely music and movie industry. There are so many pirate dvds and videos on websites but it's hard to prevent it.

<li>"Copyright with regard to digital sharing. With digital media, how are the terms of acceptable sharing (ie. ebooks, music) derived?

<li>Will the copyright laws have to be adapted to take into account the www and increase of digital information? Should a separate category be established? Are copyright laws dated? Will they help to make large corporations more powerful and manipulative in the digital world?"

<li>How does copyright apply to social media and social networking. When people retweet posts - is that infringing copyright?  

<li>Facebook - Zuckerberg vs. Winklevoss

<li>CISPA, PIPA, SOPA

<li>The supreme court case (filed in 2001, decided in January 2012) Golan v. Holder and international copyright. The ruling made it so that international works that had previously been in public domain were to have copyright restored. I think this is ridiculous,  Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf is no longer in the public domain? It doesn't make sense.

<li>One of the biggest cases, especially of our generation, has been the rampant downloading of music. With the rise of youtube, the problems are more persistent than ever. What is the debate/controversy on this field like now? 

<li>This is just a question that I had for a long time with copyright issues. When a photographer has photographed someone, who claims a more justified right? How are similar situations handled?

<li>What are the benefits to an author or creator if he or she explicitly places their work in the public domain? What do we think are the advantages to doing that? Discuss why a creator would do this instead of copyrighting his or her work. 

<li>Copyrighted material spread via Youtube/other video hosting sites.

<li>What happens when patents (a type of copyright) interferes with the free market? For example if someone invents say the vacuum and patents it, now we are only allowed to buy vacuums from that one producer. Now companies can't compete with each other eventually settling on a price that matches demand.
