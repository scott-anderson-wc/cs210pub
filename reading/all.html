<h2>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h2>

<p>In this course, you will learn three languages, which play different
  roles in the implementation of a web page:

<ul>

   <li>HTML (HyperText Markup Language).  This language specifies
   the <em>structure</em> and <em>content</em> of a web page. You can
   think of it as the flesh and bones of a site.

   <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).  This language specifies
   the <em>appearance</em>, <em>presentation</em> or <em>style</em> of a
   web page. You can think of it as the clothes, though sometimes the
   metaphor of <q>skin</q> is used.

   <li>JavaScript.  This language specifies the <em>behavior</em> of a web
   page. If the page is dynamic or interactive, it's JavaScript that
   supplies the magic.
</ul>

<p>We will begin with HTML.
</div>

<h2 id="tags">HTML Elements and Tags</h2>

<p>An HTML document is composed out of <strong>elements</strong> that
begin and end with <strong>tags</strong>. For example, the <code>H2</code>
<em>tag</em> was used to create the <em>header</em> element you see above:

<blockquote>
<table class="display">
 <tr>
   <th><code>&lt;h2&gt;</code></th>
   <th><code>HTML Elements and Tags</code></th>
   <th><code>&lt;/h2&gt;</code></th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td style="text-align: center; background-color:yellow;"><em>start tag</em></td>
   <td style="text-align: center; background-color:red;"><em>contents</em></td>
   <td style="text-align: center; background-color:cyan;"><em>end tag</em></td>
 </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<div class="new">

         &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
</div>


<p>The following are some HTML tags that you can see above. If you
forget what a tag does or are looking for a new tag, you can look up tags
in an <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/">HTML Reference</a>. (Note
  that we will <em>not</em> be learning all the tags in that reference;
  we'll learn a useful subset.) Some of the tags we've seen are:

<ul>
   <li>Structural tags like

   <ul class="compact">
      <li><code>&lt;html&gt;</code>

      <li><code>&lt;head&gt;</code>

      <li><code>&lt;title&gt;</code>

      <li><code>&lt;body&gt;</code>
   </ul>

   <li>Header tags are <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>&ndash;<code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>

   <li>Text tags like

   <ul class="compact">
      <li><code>&lt;p&gt;</code>

      <li><code>&lt;br&gt;</code>

      <li><code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>

      <li><code>&lt;em&gt;</code>

      <li><code>&lt;code&gt;</code>

      <li><code>&lt;q&gt;</code>
   </ul>

   <li>List tags:

   <ul class="compact">
      <li><code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>

      <li><code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>

      <li><code>&lt;li&gt;</code>
   </ul>

</ul>

<p>There are several other tags that you have seen, but still need to learn more
about.  
<ul>
   <li>The all-important anchor (hyperlink) tag: <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>

   <li>The image tag: <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>

   <li>Odd tags like <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code>
</ul>

<p>We'll learn more about these in this reading.

<p>Most elements have an end tag that matches the start tag. 
In a few special cases, particularly <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>
and <code>&lt;/li&gt;</code>, the end tag is optional and
may be omitted because the browser can determine it from context. 

<p>Some elements (such as <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>, 
<code>&lt;hr&gt;</code>, 
and <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>) consist only of a start tag
and do not have corresponding end tags or contents. 
These are called <strong>empty elements</strong>.

<p>Tags serve as instructions telling the browser how to 
display the contents of elements. The browser is an 
<strong>interpreter</strong> for HTML code; it reads
the HTML code and renders its elements based on rules
for each kind of tag. 

<h2 id="nesting">Nesting</h2>

<p>Multiple tags can be <em>nested</em>:  one
fits inside the other like measuring cups or Russian dolls.  If we
have two tags, <code>fred</code> and <code>barney</code>, they 
can be nested like this:

<pre>
&lt;fred&gt;
   <em>Region A</em>
      &lt;barney&gt;
         <em>Region B</em>
      &lt;/barney&gt;
   <em>Region C</em>
&lt;/fred&gt;
</pre>

<p>The <code>fred</code> tag applies to all three regions, <em>Region A</em>,
<em>Region B</em> and <em>Region C</em>, while <code>barney</code> applies only to
<em>Region B</em> that it surrounds.  The <em>Region A</em> and <em>Region C</em>
only have the <code>fred</code> tag apply to them.

<p>When nesting two tags, the inner tag must be closed before the outer tag
is closed. Your browser may not enforce this; it may be forgiving of errors,
but you can't be sure that every browser will be so forgiving, so
always follow this syntactic rule.

<h2 id="tag_syntax">Tag Syntax</h2>

<p>We learned that tags always begin with a left angle
bracket <code>&lt;</code> and close with a right angle bracket
<code>&gt;</code>. (Remember that the browser doesn't care whether the
tag's name is upper or lower case.) You can provide additional information 
within the tag to further specify what it does, using <em>attributes</em>.

<div class="new">

<h2 id="structural_tags">Structural Tags</h2>

<p>Web pages have a required structure, and so there are required
structural tags to mark the different parts. Each page has a HEAD and a
BODY, enclosed by tags with those names. These two parts are contained
within an HTML element. The HEAD contains information about the page, such
as its TITLE, so the HEAD requires the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element.
We'll learn more of these structural tags later.

<h2 id="header_tags">Header Tags</h2>

<p>Headers are just what you think they are: they're just like headings
  for chapters, sections, subsections and so forth in books, papers and
  other documents that you're used to. H1 is for things like chapters, H2
  for sections, H3 fo subsections, and so forth.

<h2 id="Text_tags">Text Tags</h2>

<p>Text tags are used for textual elements, such as creating paragraphs
  using the <code>&lt;P&gt;</code> tag, or emphasizing some text using
  the <code>&lt;EM&gt;</code> tag, and so forth.

<h2 id="List_tags">List Tags</h2>

<p>If we want to create a bullet list, we can use
  the <code>&lt;UL&gt;</code> tag, which stands for <q>unordered
  list</q>. This tag is just a <em>container</em>: it encloses a set
  of <em>list items</em>, each created by the <code>&lt;LI&gt;</code>
  tag. Thus, the following creates a list:
<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;apples
    &lt;li&gt;bananas
    &lt;li&gt;coconuts
  &lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>

<p>If you want the list items to be numbered automatically, you want
  an <em>ordered list</em>, which you can get with
  the <code>&lt;OL&gt;</code> tag.

</div>

<h2 id="hyperlinks">Hyperlinks (The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> Tag)</h2>

<p>A good example of the use of attributes is seen with the anchor
tag, <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>.  To use it as a hyperlink, you have to
specify where the link takes us. For example, to have a link that
says <q>Google</q> and takes us to <code>www.google.com</code>, we say:

<pre>&lt;a href="http://www.google.com"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

<p>The <code>href</code> part is the <em>attribute</em>.  For this tag,
since the attribute is almost always required, we can almost think of it
as an <code>a href</code> tag, but that way of thinking will confuse us
later, so it's best to think of it as two separate ideas.  Later, we'll
see other attributes for the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag.

<h3>Exercise 1</h3>

<div class="new">
<p>(Note: we will intersperse exercises like this in the reading. They are
  solely for your benefit. They are typically short and may help with
  understanding the concepts and techniques. They are not graded. We
  highly recommend that you make time for them.)
</div>

<p>To start this exercise, click on this link to <a target="_blank"
  href="http://jsfiddle.net/">JSFiddle</a>.  JSFiddle is an extremely
  popular <q>sandbox</q> that allows you to play with HTML, CSS and JS
  right in your browser, without having to launch an editor (such as
  TextWrangler), save files to your server, or any other such
  infrastructure. We'll use it a lot in this course.

<p>Copy/paste the following code into the HTML box of the JSFiddle. Then
  click the "Run" menu item to see the result.

<pre>
  &lt;p&gt;This is the text on my little page.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is some additional, very boring, text on my page.&lt;/p&gt;

</pre>

<p>Then <strong>add an</strong> <code>h1</code> 
<strong> header and an </strong><code>h2</code> <strong>header</strong> 
to the page. 
<!-- , using one of the <code>H1</code>&ndash;<code>H6</code> header tags.-->

<p>Now <strong>put in a link</strong> to your favorite website. Here are some
of ours. (To see the URL where they go 
    hover over a link and look at the left-bottom bar of your browser.)

<ul>
   <li><A HREF="http://www.bostonmagazine.com/">Boston Magazine</A>

   <li><a HREF="http://www.imdb.com/">The Internet Movie Database</a>

   <li><a HREF="http://www.reelviews.net/">ReelViews: Movie
   Reviews and Criticism by James Berardinelli </a>

   <li><a href="http://www.snopes.com/">Snopes.com Urban Legends Reference Pages</a>
</ul>

<div class="new">
<h2 id="title">The <code>title</code> tag</h2>

<p>The contents of the <code>title</code> tag doesn't appear on the body
  of the web page (though it often appears at the top of the window in the
  title bar). It is, however, very important for two reasons:
  <ul>
    <li>It tells search engines what stuff is on the page.

    <li>It appears in menus when someone bookmarks a page or looks in
    their history. 
  </ul>

<p>For both those reasons, a page title like <q>about us</q>
  or <q>contact</q> is often not helpful. It's a good idea to put
  something more descriptive in the title, such as <q>About CS 110</q>
  or <q>CS 110 staff contact information.</q>
</div>

<h2 id="here_links">The <q>Here</q> Link</h2>

<p>Once, it was very popular on the web to have links like this:
  <ul>
    <li>Click <a href="http://google.com/search?as_q=apple+pie+recipes">here</a> for
    apple pie recipes
    <li>Click <a href="http://google.com/search?as_q=peach+pie+recipes">here</a> for
    peach pie recipes
    <li>Click <a href="http://google.com/search?as_q=prune+pie+recipes">here</a> for
    prune pie recipes
  </ul>

<p>It seemed so clever and intuitive, making the clickable text be the
  word "here."  There are two big problems with this, though:
  <ul>

    <li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: Screen-reading software for the
    blind often will read the text of the links on a page so that the user
    can easily navigate to other pages.  Links like those above read as
    "here," "here," "here" &mdash; useless.

    <li><strong>Indexing</strong>: Search engines pay special attention to
    the click text on a page, since those are often an important clue
    about the content of the destination page.  The links above don't show
    what the important words are.
  </ul>

<p>So what do you do instead?  Just wrap the link tags around important
  words:

  <ul>
    <li>Here are some <a href="http://google.com/search?as_q=apple+pie+recipes">
    apple pie recipes</a>.
    <li>Click here for <a href="http://google.com/search?as_q=peach+pie+recipes">
    peach pie recipes</a>.
    <li>Yo, check out the <a href="http://google.com/search?as_q=prune+pie+recipes">
    prune pie recipes</a>.
  </ul>

<p>Accessibility is very important in CS 110, so keep that in mind.

<h2 id="link">The LINK tag</h2>

<p>In the <code>head</code> element of each CS110 lecture page, you'll see 
some HTML that looks something like: 

<pre>
   &lt;link href="http://cs.wellesley.edu/~cs110/cs110-main-style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"&gt;
</pre>

<p>Like the anchor tag, the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag also has an
<code>href</code> attribute, and it also links one web page with another.
However, it has a different purpose.  Instead of producing a clickable
link, the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag tells the browser that there is
some additional information about this page located in a different file.
The <code>href</code> attribute of the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag tells
the browser where to find the other file.  The <code>href</code> attribute
contains a URL, which we'll learn about later.

<p>The <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag contains other attributes depending
on the purpose of the connection.  In our case, it contains: <ul>

   <li>a <code>rel</code> attribute that says what the RELationship
   the other file has to this one.  We use it to specify a
   <em>style sheet</em>, which says how tags should be formatted.

   <li>a <code>type</code> attribute that says what kind of stuff the
   other file contains.  In our case, we say that the file contains
   <code>text/css</code>. 

</ul>

<div class="alert alert-danger">In HTML5, the attribute <code>type</code> is not
        required anymore. The reason is that
        CSS is declared the default style for HTML5. However, you might see <code>type</code>
        in our older examples and in many pages on the Web. It is not an error to use it,
        but it's not required anymore.
</div>

<p>The <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag <em>can</em> be used for a variety of
purposes, but most current browsers only use it for style sheets.

<p>At this point, the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag is still a mystery.
We've told you what it's for, and something about its syntax, but not what
goes in the other file.  We'll learn more about the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>
tag, style sheets and CSS in later lectures.

<h4>Exercise 2</h4>

<p>Modify the JSFiddle from the previous exercise by adding the
following <code>link</code> element near the top.  (You'll get a minor
  complaint from JSFiddle, but you can ignore it.)

<pre>
&lt;link href="https://cs.wellesley.edu/~cs110/cs110-main-style.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
</pre>

<p>How does this affect the appearance of the document? 

<p>In the modified document, how can you change the appearance of an 
unvisited hyperlink from blue text to text that is large and green? 
(Hint: use a header tag.)


<h2 id="attributes">Tag and Attribute Syntax</h2>

<p>We can now generalize start tag syntax to include any number of
attributes, as follows:

<pre>
&lt;tag attr1 = "value1" attr2 = "value2" ... attrN = "valueN"&gt; 
   <em>contents</em>
&lt;/tag&gt;
</pre>

<p>Browsers differ on how nit-picky they are about attributes.  Many will
let you get away with omitting the quotation marks when the value is a
single solid word (no spaces in the value).  Others will complain if you
have line-breaks in your attributes.  In general, it's best to comply with
the strictest syntax rules, so that your site will work on the most
browsers.

<p>Note that some versions of HTML, namely XHTML, require attributes to be
in quotation marks.  We're using HTML5, which is much more liberal, and
will let you omit quotation marks unless the value contains a space, a
line break, grave accent (&grave;), equals sign (=), less than sign
(&lt;), greater than sign (&gt;), quote (&quot;) or apostrophe (&apos;).
In short, if there's anything confusing in the value, use quotation marks.
<!--For the purposes of this course, you may omit unnecessary quotation marks.
You'll find that your instructors aren't always consistent.-->

<h2 id="images">Using Images</h2>

<p>One thing that we all want to do with our web pages is add pictures.
Because the picture file is a separate file, we have to link to it, just
like the <code>href</code> attribute of the anchor
(<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>) tag.

<p>Once you have an image file, say <code>small_weasel.jpg</code> you can
use it on your web page like this:

<pre>
&lt;img src = "small_weasel.jpg" alt = "a small weasel"&gt;
</pre>

<p>with the following result:</P>

<blockquote><p><img src="small_weasel.jpg" alt="a small weasel" width=289 height=234></blockquote>

<p>Of course, this only works if the server can find the image file.
The <code>src</code> attribute must be
the <a href="URLs.html"><em>URL</em></a> of the image file. It can be an
absolute URL or a relative URL. What did we use here?

<p>When the browser asks for this page, the server sends it back and it
also finds and sends back any image files that the page references. If the
server doesn't find the file (or the file is corrupted in some way), the
browser will show this:

<blockquote><p><img src="small_weasel-not-found.jpg" alt="a small weasel"></blockquote>

<p>Depending on your browser, you may see a broken-image icon above, the
  <code>alt</code> text, or possibly nothing at all.

<h4>Exercise 3</h4>

<p>Modify the JSfiddle to display an image of the weasel. (Of course, you
could replace this image by any other image you'd like!)  Note that in
    this case, you <em>must</em> use an absolute URL for the IMG, namely:

<pre>
http://cs.wellesley.edu/~cs110/reading/small_weasel.jpg
</pre>

<p>Add a <code>title</code> attribute with value <code>"small weasel image"</code>
to the image.  What does this do? 


<h3 id="ALT">The ALT Attribute</h3>

<p>You noticed that we added an ALT attribute to the IMG tag that is a
small piece of text that can be used in place of the image in certain
circumstances.  The ALT attribute is an important part of the HTML
standard.  Perhaps its most important use supports
<em>accessibility</em>.  Unfortunately, not everyone has good enough
vision to see the images that we use in our websites, but that
doesn't mean they can't and don't use the Web.  Instead, they
(typically) have software that reads a web page to them, including
links.  When the software gets to an IMG tag, it reads the
ALT text.  If there is no ALT text, it may read the SRC attribute,
hoping there's a hint there, but all too often the SRC attribute is
something like <code>"../images/DCN87372.jpg"</code> and the visually 
impaired web user is left to guess.

<p>Therefore, you should always include a brief, useful value for the ALT
attribute.  If your page is an image gallery, then your ALT text could be
a description of the image.  However, describing the image is not, in
general, the idea.  For example, if the image is a link whose target is
made clear by the image, then the ALT text should say something like,
"Link to ..." so the user will know what to do with it.  The sole
exception is for images that are just used for formatting, such as blank
pictures that fill areas or colorful bullets for bullet lists.  In those
cases, in fact, it's better to include an ALT attribute that
is <em>empty</em>, so that the user doesn't have to listen to the SRC
attribute being read.  In both cases, the text should be useful for
someone who wants to use your site but isn't sighted.  It helps to turn
off images and view your site to check.

<p>Furthermore, you should avoid having critical information on your website
conveyed only in images.  There may be times when it is unavoidable, but
to the extent that it is possible, we want our websites to be easily
usable by all people, including the blind and visually impaired.

<p>Accessibility is important in modern society.  We build ramps as well
as stairs, we put cutouts in curbs, and we allocate parking spaces for the
handicapped.  Indeed, most federal and state government websites are
legally required to be accessible, and ALT attributes are just one part of
that.

<p>In this class, we expect you to always use the
ALT attribute. If you find an image or an example where we've forgotten to
use one, please bring it to our attention.

<p>For more information, you can read the following
<ul>

    <li><a href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/feature/art3.htm"> more thorough
    discussion of ALT </a>

    <li><a href="http://www.pantos.org/atw/35534.html">The Art of ALT</a>

</ul> 

<h3 id="aspectratio">Resizing and Aspect Ratio</h3>

<p>If you want to display a bunch of pictures, the web page appears neater if
the pictures align well.  You can align them vertically if they all have
the same width, or horizontally if they all have the same height.  For
example, the following three pictures are all 150 pixels high.

<blockquote>
<p>
  <img src="HTML-files/molehill.jpeg" alt="a molehill" height="150">
  <img src="HTML-files/eiffel-tower.jpeg" alt="the Eiffel Tower" height="150">
  <img src="HTML-files/matterhorn.jpeg" alt="the Matterhorn" height="150">
</blockquote>

<p>Regardless of the actual dimensions of an image, the browser will
squeeze it into a set size if requested.  You can do this with two new
attributes, namely <strong>HEIGHT</strong> and <strong>WIDTH</strong>:

<pre>
&lt;img src="..." alt="..."  height="<span style='font-style: italic'>height-goes-here</span>"   width="<span style='font-style: italic'>width-goes-here</span>"&gt;
</pre>

<p>Replace the "height-goes-here" and "width-goes-here" with integers
specified in <!--a href="../M01-color/index.html#pixel"--><em>pixels</em>,
which we'll discuss later.  If both width and height are specified, both
will be obeyed, but you have to be careful with that.  Suppose the
original image is 160x240: taller than it is wide.  Technically, the ratio
of the width to the height is called the <strong>aspect ratio</strong>.
The Eiffel Tower picture has an aspect ratio of 160:240 or 2:3.  If you
set the height and width so that they don't have the same aspect ratio,
the picture will look distorted. Here is the Eiffel Tower with the wrong
aspect ratio:

<blockquote>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
&lt;img src="eiffel-tower.jpeg" alt="the Eiffel Tower" width="300" height="150"&gt;
</pre>
<p><img src="HTML-files/eiffel-tower.jpeg" alt="the Eiffel Tower" width="300" height="150">
</blockquote>

<p>If you use <em>either</em> the HEIGHT or the WIDTH attributes, but not
<em>both</em>, the browser will usually calculate the other attribute so
that the aspect ratio is preserved.  Thus, the picture will have either
the width or height you want, but will not be distorted.  That's how we
did that row of pictures above.

<h4>Exercise 4</h4>

<p>Modify the JSfiddle to display an image of the Eiffel tower next to the
  weasel so that both images have the same height. You'll have to use an
  absolute URL for both images:

<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>

<p>From the very first computer program, programmers have needed to
leave <q>notes</q> in the code to help themselves and others understand
what's going on or what the code's purpose is.  These notes are called
<em>comments.</em> Comments are a part of the program text (they're
not written separately, because then, well, they'd get separated),
but they are ignored by the computer. Comments aren't about what someone 
can discover by reading the code, but should cover the background context 
of the code, or its goal.

<p>Because it's important to get in the habit of putting comments in your
HTML code, we will <em>require</em> comments in this course. At this
point, you won't have a lot to say, and that's fine.  You will start by
labeling each file with its name, your name, the date, and any sources you 
consulted (such as the source code of other web pages).  Think of this as
signing your work.  Later, when you're designing a website with many
coordinated pages, you can use comments on a page to talk about how it
fits into the overall plan. 

<h2 id="html_comments">HTML Comment Syntax</h2>

<p>The HTML comment syntax is a little odd-looking.
<!-- because it doesn't have any letters in it.  -->
Here's an example:

<pre>&lt;!-- I can say anything I want in a comment.  --&gt;</pre>

<p>The syntax starts with a left angle bracket <code>&lt;</code> then an
exclamation point and two hyphens, then the comment (anything you
want) and ends with two hyphens and a right angle bracket <code>&gt;</code>.
<!--You can see other examples of comments by viewing the source of this
web page (select View/View Source in Safari or Tools/Web Developer/Page Source 
in Firefox).-->

<!-- Do HTML comments nest properly? Lyn checked, but unclear from documentation -->

<h2 id="beauty">Beauty in Websites</h2>

<p>Ah, but you object that your web page looks <em>ugly</em> without
centering, font changes, colors, and so forth.  That may be; we're not
going to try to contradict your aesthetic sense.  However, for the first
week of this course, we don't want to confuse anyone by introducing style
sheets right away.  So, we ask you to be patient.  We will get to style
sheets very soon.</p>

<p>In the meantime, consider the fact that many visitors to your site
might not gain any advantage from style sheets anyway, because they are
visually impaired, or because they are using an old or alternative browser that
doesn't honor style sheets.  For such users, the most important thing is
the <em>content</em> and having that content well-structured and clearly
conveyed.  So, until we get to style sheets, consider that you are
designing your website with accessibility in mind.

<h2 id="debugging">Bugs and Debugging</h2>

<p>An HTML document may contain many different kinds of errors
that prevent it from rendering as you expect. 
Errors in code are known as <strong>bugs</strong>, and the process
of finding and correcting such errors is called 
<strong>debugging</strong>. 

<p>Here are some common types of HTML bugs:

<ul>

<li> a tag name is misspelled/wrong, such as <code style="color:red;">&lt;tilte&gt;</code>
     or <code style="color:red;">&lt;break&gt;</code>.

<li> a start tag is used in place of an end tag: 

<blockquote style="color:red;">
<p>&lt;em&gt;important&lt;em&gt;
</blockquote>

<li> a tag is malformed: 

<blockquote style="color:red;">
<p>&lt;em important&lt;/em&gt;
</blockquote>


<li> an element has an end tag that doesn't match the start tag:

<blockquote style="color:red;">
<p>&lt;h1&gt;CS110 HTML Coding&lt;/h2&gt;
</blockquote>

<li> tags aren't nested properly (really just a special case of the previous bug): 

<blockquote style="color:red;">
<p>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;em&gt;CS110 HTML Coding&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;em&gt;
</blockquote>

<li> attribute names are misspelled/wrong: 

<blockquote style="color:red;">
<p>&lt;img source="logo.jpg" hieght=100&gt;
</blockquote>

<li> quote marks aren't properly matched: 

<blockquote style="color:red;">
<p>&lt;img src="logo.jpg height=100&gt;
</blockquote>

</ul>


<h4>Exercise 5</h4>

<p>Copy the following buggy HTML code into a JSfiddle
and debug the code until it looks like you think it's intended to look. 

<pre>
&lt;h1&gt;A Buggy HTML File&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This HTML file contains several &lt;em&gt;bugs&lt;/em&gt; (i.e., errors).
&lt;br&gt;
Can you &lt;em&gt;debug&lt;/em&gt; them (i.e., find and fix them)?

&lt;p&gt;Here's an unordered list with three items: 

&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;strong&lt;/strong&gt; item.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;An ordered sublist with two items: 

        &lt;ol&gt; 

          &lt;p&gt; A CAPITALIZED item 

          &lt;li&gt; An &lt;a href="http://www.wellesley.edu"&gt;
                  &lt;em&gt;italic link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;

    &lt;li&gt; A final &lt;code&gt;item&lt;code&gt;, using code font.

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href="http://cs.wellesley.edu another link&lt;/a&gt;

</pre><!-- close that extra quotation mark: " -->


<h2 id="validation">Validation of HTML Code</h2>

<p>How can you be sure you've followed every nit-picky rule that the HTML
standards committee devised?  (The standards committee is
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/"><q>World Wide Web Consortium</q></a> or
W3C.)  Even if you have memorized all the rules, checking a page would be
tedious and error-prone &ndash; perfect for a computer!  Fortunately, the
W3C created an <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">HTML validator</a>.  You
can validate by supplying a URL, by uploading a file, or even
copy/pasting in some HTML.  Visit that page and try validating
your <code>little.html</code> file, 
debugged <code>buggy.html</code> file,
or even the file for this lecture. 
An HTML validator is an excellent tool to help you debug your HTML code. 


<p>Validation also helps with accessibility. 
One important aspect of accessibility is having the proper HTML syntax
for each page in your site.  Visitors with accessibility needs will use
the alternative browsers and screen readers, and that software will be
aided by syntactically correct HTML.  Read the following for a longer
discussion
of <a href="http://validator.w3.org/docs/help.html#why-validate">why to
validate your HTML pages</a>.


<p>Throughout the semester, if you need to validate a web page, you can
find the HTML validator and others in the <a
href="../documentation/">validators
section of the CS110 documentation page</a>.

<p>If you haven't already, try validating <code>little.html</code>.
You'll see that it doesn't validate.  The reasons are slightly technical,
so bear with us, but you'll see how to make your own documents valid.

<h3 id="doctype">Document Type</h3>

<p>There are several different, incompatible HTML versions, and so a
  document that is valid HTML 3.2 is invalid HTMl 4.01 and vice versa.
  Neither would be valid XHTML 1.0.  So, the validator needs to know what
  version of HTML you're using.  More importantly, the browser or screen
  reader or other software needs to know what syntax to expect.
  Therefore, the first thing any web page needs to do is announce the
  syntax it's using.  This is done with a special <code>DOCTYPE</code>
  (for <q>document type</q>) tag.  

  <p>In this course, we're using HTML5.  (Your book describes HTML 4.01
  (and also XHTML), but HTML 4.01 is essentially a subset of HTML5, so
  nothing they tell you will be incorrect.)  Fortunately, the doctype for
  HTML5 is very simple and easy, certainly compared to HTML 4.01.  It
  looks like this:

    <pre>
      &lt;!doctype html&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>We urge you just to copy/paste that tag to your own pages and don't
  worry about it further.

    <p><em>Note</em>:  because HTML5 is still pretty new, the validator at W3C
    will give you a warning that the result is "experimental." 

<h3 id="charset">Charset</h3>

<p>A browser needs to know what <em>characters</em> (letters, numbers,
and punctuation) are in the HTML file.  Are they <q>western
European</q> characters, or Russian, Greek, Sanskrit, Korean, Japanese,
Chinese, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/!Kung_people">!Kung</a>
or something else?  This information is called the <em>character set</em>
or <em>charset</em> for short.  For our purposes, we can use something
called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8"><q>UTF-8</q></a>.</p>

<p>To do so, we put a <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag in
the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of our document.  It looks like this:</p>

<pre>
 &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
</pre>

<p>Again, we urge you just to copy/paste that code and don't worry about
it.</p>

<!-- Scott, Jan 2015, omitted this exercise, because it doesn't work well with JSfiddle

<h4>Exercise 6</h4>

<p>Copy the DOCTYPE and CHARSET code into <code>little.html</code>
   and/or the debugged <code>buggy.html</code>
   and check that the result is now valid.

-->

<h3 id="valid_icon">Icon Declaring Validation</h3>

<p>Once you get your page to validate, you can put some HTML code on your
page to give it a <q>seal of approval</q>, declaring that it is valid (and
what standard it meets). You will see in lab examples of this strategy.  
<!--You can see an example on the bottom of the
CS110 pages, including this one.-->

<p>The very cool thing about this icon is that it is clickable, and
clicking it will cause the validator to process your page again.  Thus,
you can modify your page, upload the changes, and click the icon to
re-validate it, making validation <em>very</em> easy.  In fact, we suggest
that you put the icon on your page <em>before</em> it's valid, and use it
during your debugging process.</p>

<p>The snippet of code is just the following, so go ahead and copy/paste
  it into your pages. The code doesn't use anything we don't know, so read
  it!

<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer"&gt;
     &lt;img 
       src="http://cs.wellesley.edu/~cs110/Icons/valid-html5v2.png"
       alt="Valid HTML 5"
       title="Valid HTML 5"  
       height="31" width="88"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

<h2 id="template">An HTML Template</h2>

<p>The preceding requirements result in a kind of <q>boilerplate</q> that
  you'll need for all your web pages. Feel free to copy/paste the
  following to begin all your HTML pages, or to use
  this <a href="HTML-files/template.html">template.html</a>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"&gt;
    &lt;meta name=author content="Your name here"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;title here&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer"&gt;
     &lt;img 
       src="http://cs.wellesley.edu/~cs110/Icons/valid-html5v2.png"
       alt="Valid HTML 5"
       title="Valid HTML 5"  
       height="31" width="88"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

<div class="new">
<h2 id="div_intro">DIV and CSS</h2>

<p>This section introduces the DIV tag. The DIV tag is a <q>generic</q>
  container tag, which doesn't make a lot of sense yet, but will in the
  next few readings. To motivate the DIV tag, we'll talk a little about
  CSS, but not in a complete or definitive way, so bear with us on
  that. We'll get to CSS very soon.

<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the style language for web pages. Here
  is one way (not even the best way) to put a green box around a
  paragraph:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
  &lt;p style="border: 3px solid green"&gt;Success makes so many people hate you... &amp;mdash;
  Marilyn Monroe&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

<p>Here it is in action:

<blockquote>
  <p style="border: 3px solid green">Success makes so many people hate you... &mdash;
  Marilyn Monroe</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So far, so good. If we wanted to put a box around <em>two</em>
  paragraphs, we would need an element that contains both those
  paragraphs. It turns out that HTML paragraphs can't contain other HTML
  paragraphs, which makes sense because normal everyday paragraphs don't
  contain other paragraphs. 

<p>None of the other HTML elements really work either, so to handle this
situation, the World Wide Web HTML standards committee created
the <code>&lt;DIV&gt;</code> tag, standing for a <q>division</q> of your
document. A DIV can contain anything (paragraphs, lists, headers, and even
other DIVs). Consequently, DIV is very useful and is used a lot. A more
real-world example is a putting a set of links into a DIV and positioning
that to be a navigation area, or putting a set of paragraphs in a DIV to
create a set of posts.  We will use it a lot in CS 110, though we will
also use some newer tags that are intended to reduce the over-use of DIV.

</div>

<h2 id="need-for-meaningful-tags">The need for meaningful tags</h2>

<p>As we've said, HTML was designed to structure the content of a web
  page.  That explains the existence of tags like <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>,
  <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>, etc. However, when web
  developers started creating pages with a lot of content, it became clear
  that to make better use of the available screen space, a way to organize
  the page content in bigger chunks was needed. Then, CSS could be used to
  arrange their position on the page. Therefore, the
  tag <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> was born (short for <em>division</em>),
  which is currently the most used (and overused) tag in every
  webpage. While this seemed to have solved the page layout problem, HTML
  code became difficult to understand, other computer programs
  (e.g. search engines) couldn't make sense of all divs in a page, if they
  wanted to use the organization of the page for inferring the meaning of
  the content.</p>

<p>HTML5 introduced a series of new tags that have meaningful names and
  can be used universally to express what the content is about, beyond the
  existing simple tags. Additionally, to make the pages more alive with
  different kinds of content, several new tags that allow content to be
  embedded in a page were also added.  In the following, we will give a
  short summary of some of these tags. Try to make use of them in your
  pages. They will make your code better and more readable to the programs
  of the future.</p>

<h2 id="semantic">Semantic Tags</h2>

<p>Here is a list of new HTML5 tags that are known as semantic tags,
  because their names have specific meaning. Click on the <q>info</q> icon

<h4>Browser Support</h4>

<p>Changing the web language standards goes 
  through a lengthy process spearheaded by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">
    <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr></a> consortium.
  The vendors of the browsers need often many years to implement all the
  changes.  Therefore, not all new HTML5 are currently supported by all

<p>HTML5 also introduces more meaningful tags to support embedding media resources

          <h3 id="video">The &lt;video&gt; tag</h3>
          <p>Here is an example of embedding video directly on your page:</p>

          <div class="text-center">
            <video controls
                 src="http://clips.vorwaerts-gmbh.de/big_buck_bunny.mp4"
                 width="300"
                 id="bunny_video"></video>
          </div>

          <blockquote>
            <pre>
  &lt;video controls
            src="http://clips.vorwaerts-gmbh.de/big_buck_bunny.mp4"
            width="300"
            id="bunny_video"
  &gt;
          </pre>
          </blockquote>

         <p>The attributes <code>controls</code> and <code>autoplay</code>
           are called boolean attributes.  A tag either has them or
           doesn't have them. Here, we've omitted autoplay, so that the
           page won't make noise when you load it.</p>

          <h3 id="audio">The &lt;audio&gt; tag</h3>

          <p>Here is an example of embedding audio directly on your page:</p>

<h2 id="testing">Live Testing</h2>

<p>Often you want simply to try out new elements or their combination,
 without having to write a complete HTML document. We have already seen
 how the documentation for the HTML tags by
 the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools website</a> provides an
 editing space where to experiment with tags. However, there are many more
 tools on the web that allow you to do the same, for all three languages
 at once: HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>

<p>One tool that we will be using during lecture time for experimentation is 
  <a href="http://jsfiddle.net">jsfiddle</a>.
  Here is a screenshot from trying out the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>
  tag directly in its workspace.

          <h2 id="absolute">Absolute URLs</h2>

          <div>
            URLs are used to specify the locations of resources in files on
            any computer in the world, so they can be a little complex.
            Taking as an example the URL of the page you are reading:
          </div>
          <p></p>
          <blockquote>
            <table class="table-bordered">
              <tr>
                <th>protocol</th>
                <th>server.domain</th>
                <th>path</th>
                <th>filename</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><code>https://</code> </td>
                <td><code>cs210.wellesley.edu</code></td>
                <td><code>/reading/</code></td>
                <td><code>URLs.html</code></td>
              </tr>
            </table>
          </blockquote>

          <p>let's break it down in its components:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><code>http://</code>&nbsp;This is the protocol, which is
            almost always HTTP, the HyperText Transfer Protocol, or HTTPS,
            its secure counterpart. You'll occasionally see FTP and
            others.</li>

            <li><code>cs210.wellesley.edu</code>&nbsp; This is
             the <em>server</em>: a machine connected to the internet that
             hands out files to anyone who asks. <code>cs210</code> is the
             name of the machine;
             <code>wellesley.edu</code> is the domain. The name of the
             server combined with the domain must be <em>unique</em> in
             the <em>world</em>. In fact, the domain must be unique in the
             world, and the server name must be unique within the
             domain.</li>

            <li><code>/reading/</code>&nbsp;This is the
             <em>path</em>: a sequence of directories (AKA folders),
             separated by slashes, that indicates where on the server the
             file is located. Here there is only one folder, but there
             could be several.</li>

            <li><code>URLs.html</code>&nbsp;This is the file that is being
            requested.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Because URLs can specify files on many different kinds of
            computers, you should stick to a lowest common denominator when
            naming your directories and files, to avoid confusing machines and
            browsers. The lowest common denominator means:

          <ul>
            <li>use letters and digits, but no special characters like /, *,
            #, &amp;, and so forth</li>
            <li><strong>no spaces</strong> (this is the most common error for Mac and PC
            users). For example, if you want to have a web page named
            <code>cats and dogs.html</code> you're much safer
            with <code>cats-and-dogs.html</code> or
            <code>cats_and_dogs.html</code></li>

          </ul>

          <p>Furthermore, be careful with upper and lower case. To your eyes,
          <CODE>cats.html</CODE> and <CODE>Cats.html</CODE> may seem like the
          same filename, but to a computer, they're as different as
          <CODE>cats.html</CODE> and <CODE>dogs.html</CODE>. The same rule is true
          of directory names: they are case-sensitive. Many people like to stick to
          all lower-case, just so they don't have to remember. </p>

          <p>Certain parts of the end of an absolute URL can be omitted.
          For example, the filename can be omitted and (usually) defaults
          to a file named <code>index.html</code> in the specified
          directory (for an example, see
          our <a href="http://cs210.wellesley.edu/">course
          homepage</a>). Similarly, the path can be omitted, in which case
          the page is in the <q>top</q> directory of the web server.
          However, <em>the protocol and server must be specified</em>. You
          can't omit those.  If a URL has a protocol, it's an
          <strong>absolute URL</strong>, otherwise it'll be treated as a 
          <strong>relative URL</strong>.</p>


          <h2 id="trees">Tree Structured Directories</h2>

          <p>As you know, most operating systems (including Mac, Windows, Unix, iOS, Android, etc.),
            organize the contents of a computer's hard drive into 
            <em>folders</em>, also called <em>directories</em>. Folders and files form
            a <q>tree</q> structure, because of the ability of directories to contain
            other directories.

            <p>Here's an example:
              <blockquote>
                For a website about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon">Joss Whedon</a>, 
                we might have a folder about his
                Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV show, another about the TV show Angel, and
                a document about his comics.  These might all be in a top-level folder
                called <q>Joss</q>.  (The top-level folder is also called
                the <em>root</em> folder.) The folders about the TV shows might each have a
                sub-folder called <q>cast</q>.  And so on.
              </blockquote>

            <p>While it's easy to conceptualize a tree of folders and files, also
              called a <em>directory tree</em>, there are many different ways to draw
              it.  Here are several ways of depicting the <a href="Joss/">Joss directory tree</a>
              described above that you will see in this course:

            <figure>
              <img src="URLs-files/images/Joss-dirtree-hand-new.png" alt="Joss directory tree drawn by hand" 
                   class="img-thumbnail center-block">
              <figcaption>A hand drawing for the Joss Whedon website.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure>
              <img src="URLs-files/images/Joss-dirtree-mac.png" alt="Joss directory tree on a Mac"
                   class="img-thumbnail center-block">
              <figcaption>The folder structure as displayed in Mac by <strong>Finder</strong>.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <figure>
              <img src="URLs-files/images/Joss-dirtree-win.png" alt="Joss directory tree on Windows"
                    class="img-thumbnail center-block">
              <figcaption>The folder structure as displayed in Windows by <strong>Windows Explorer</strong>.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>For example, we can see that <code>buffy.html</code> and <code>willow.html</code> are both
            files in the same directory, the one called <code>cast</code>, which is, in turn, one
            of three things in the directory called <code>Buffy</code>, which is in the directory
            called <code>Joss</code>. Joss contains two directories (Buffy and Angel) and a file
            called <code>comics.html</code> and so on. Take a minute to be sure you understand
            the relationships among the directories and files.  Notice that there
            are <em>two</em> files named <code>angel.html</code>; this is okay, because they
            are in different directories.</p>

          <H2 id="relative">Relative URLs</H2>

          <p>We can use these relationships to form a shorthand way of
          specifying a URL. This is called a <EM>relative</EM> URL, because we
          specify the location of a file relative to a known file. Here are the
          basic rules:

          <ol>
             <li>Relative URLs are only for files on the same server.
             Therefore, we can leave off the protocol and server name.

             <li>If a file is in the same directory as the HTML file containing
             the link, we just give its name.  If
             we want to put a link <EM>in</EM> the file <CODE>buffy.html</CODE>
             linking it to <code>willow.html</code>, we can say:

            <pre class="prettyprint">
              <code>&lt;a href="willow.html"&gt;her best friend Willow&lt;/a&gt;</code>
            </pre>

               <li>If a file is in a sibling subdirectory, we can just give the
               path starting from the sibling. So, if we are in the file called
               <code>mythology.html</code> and we want to give a link to the file
               <code>angel.html</code>, we can say:

            <pre class="prettyprint">
              <code>&lt;a href="cast/angel.html"&gt;Angel, the vampire with a soul&lt;/a&gt;</code>
            </pre>

               <li>If the file is in a directory that contains a subdirectory that 
               contains the HTML file with the link,
               we have to go <q>up</q> the tree. To go up, we
               write <code>../</code>. That's <q>dot, dot, slash.</q> For example, if we
               are in the file <code>host.html</code> and we want to make a link to
               <code>season3.html,</code> we can say:

            <pre class="prettyprint">
              <code>&lt;a href="../season3.html"&gt;the Host returned in season 3&lt;/a&gt;</code>
            </pre>

               That last step, with the <code>..</code> is tricky: to go up, we write
               <code>..</code>; while to go down we have to indicate which subdirectory
               we mean. In either case, we separate these up/down steps with a
               slash. Here's another example: suppose we want to put a link
               from <code>buffy.html</code> to <code>comics.html</code>. In this case,
               we can write:

            <pre class="prettyprint">
            <code>&lt;a href="../../comics.html"&gt;another layer in the comics&lt;/a&gt;</code>
            </pre>

          </ol>

          <h2 id="fragments">Fragments</h2>

          <p>The model above establishes a one-to-one correspondence
            between a URL and a file (web page) somewhere in the vast web.
            Sometimes, however, you want to address (point to) a
            particular location <em>within</em> a page. Such locations are
            called <em>fragments</em>.  Here is a link
            to <a href="#fragments">this section of this page</a>
            (actually the header of the section). Try it!</p>

          <p>While fragments can be used in many ways, one common use is to have
            a <q>table of contents</q> at the top of a page, allowing readers to skip
            down to the particular section they are interested in.  An example of
            such a table of contents is at the left side of these notes.</p>

          <p>Fragments are addressed by extending the URL by adding
            a <code>#</code> character and
            the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_id.asp">id</a>
            attribute of the fragment (the HTML element that we are
            referring to).  Thus, we have:</p>

          <p>
          <blockquote>
            <table class="table-bordered">
                <tr>
                   <th>protocol</th>
                   <th>server.domain</th>
                   <th>path</th>
                   <th>filename</th>
                   <th>fragment id</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                   <td><code>https://</code> </td>
                   <td><code>cs210.wellesley.edu</code></td>
                   <td><code>/reading</code></td>
                   <td><code>URLs.html</code></td>
                   <td><code>#relative</code></td>
                </tr>
            </table>
          </blockquote>

          <p>One key step is marking the <em>destination</em> of the URL,
            by <em>naming</em> the fragment, just as we name a file or folder. This
            is done with the <code>id</code> attribute, which can be applied to
            every HTML tag.  We typically add it to the header tag (such
            as <code>h2</code>) of the section we want to skip to.  For example:

            <pre class="prettyprint">
            <code>&lt;h2 id="relative"&gt;Relative URLs&lt;/h2&gt;</code>
          </pre>

          <p>Given the code above, we can then point to that section from any web
            page anywhere, using an absolute URL, like the one in the table above.
            We can also use fragments with relative URLs.  For example, to point to
            that section from another file in the same directory, we can just give
            the filename and the fragment name: <code>URLs.html#relative</code>. In
            fact, if we want to point to it from within the same file, we can omit
            the filename and the relative URL becomes just <code>#relative</code>.
            You can see examples of that kind of URL in the table of contents on the 
            sidebar.

        Reading: We strongly suggest you read chapter 7
        of <em><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596159924.do">Head
        First HTML and CSS</a></em> with these notes.
      </div>

          <p>When HTML was first introduced, there were a number of tags whose
            purpose was just for formatting: for example, tags that center or switch
            to an italic font.  With HTML version 4.0, such tags were made obsolete
            (though most browsers still support them), in favor of a formatting
            technique called <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em>.</p>

          <h2 id="customizing">Customizing Your Tags</h2>

          <p>When a browser is displaying a page, there is a step of reading a
          tag, such as <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and
          then determining what the results are to look like.  (This is
          sometimes called <em>rendering</em> a page.)  Each browser has a default
          way of rendering a tag.  For example, most browsers will render the
          <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag by switching to an italic version of the current
          font.  Most browsers will render an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag by switching
          to a very large version of the current font.  There are several important points
          to make about this:</p>

          <ul>

           <li>Different browsers don't necessarily render a tag the same way.
           For example, you might find that <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> in Safari
           indents by a different amount than Internet Explorer does.

           </li><li>Some control is transferred to the user.  A user can decide, via their
           browser <em>preferences</em>, what font families and font sizes they want
           to use, or what colors their links should be.  This is a good thing.

           </li><li>As the author of a web page, you can customize the rendering or
           <em>style</em> of tags in your pages.  For example, if you want the
           <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag to look red, you can do that.  The style of tags
           is determined by something called <em>CSS</em>, for Cascading Style
           Sheets.

          </li></ul>

          <h2 id="sheets">CSS Style Sheets</h2>

          <p>You can specify the style of a tag using a <em>style sheet</em>.  These
          style sheets can be put in (at least) three different places:

          </p>

<pre><code>      &lt;div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning"&gt;
      &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inline Styles.&lt;/em&gt;  These are specified in the tag itself.

      &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Document-Level (Internal) Style Sheets.&lt;/em&gt; These are 
      specified in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; of a document, using the special 
      tag &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

      &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;External Style Sheets.&lt;/em&gt; These are specified in a
      separate CSS file that is connected to the HTML file by the
      &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag.  We discussed this link in the
        &lt;a href="HTML.html#link"&gt;HTML reading&lt;/a&gt;.
      &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Suppose that we always want &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to be red
        in addition to being in italics.  (Be aware
        of &lt;a href="#accessibility"&gt;accessibility&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;ol&gt;

      &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inline Style.&lt;/em&gt; You use the &lt;code&gt;style&lt;/code&gt;
      &lt;em&gt;attribute&lt;/em&gt; of the tag to set the &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt;
      property to have the &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; red and the
      &lt;code&gt;background-color&lt;/code&gt; property to have the &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; white.
      (You should be reminded of the attribute/value idea in tags, but
      the syntax is different.  With CSS, property/value pairs are
      separated by semi-colons, and the property ends with a colon.)
      Note that you should always &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/color"&gt;pick both colors&lt;/a&gt;, in
      case the user's browser has specified a background color that
      matches your foreground color.  Here's the example:
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="html">
this is an <code class="html"><span class="nt">&lt;em</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">&quot;color: red; background-color: white&quot;</span>&gt;important<span class="nt">&lt;/em&gt;</span></code> word
</code></pre>

<pre><code>which results in:&lt;br&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;this is an &lt;em style="background-color: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%; color: red;"&gt;important&lt;/em&gt; word
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Document-Level (Internal) Style Sheets.&lt;/em&gt; You use the
&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;tag&lt;/em&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; of your
document to specify the style for the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag once and
for all:
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="css">&lt;style&gt;
   em { 
      color: red; 
      background-color: white;
   }
&lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;In your document (that is, in the tags enclosed by &amp;lt;&lt;code&gt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;), 
  you just use the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag normally, and it will be rendered as red.
&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>

<p><li><em>External Style Sheets.</em> These look just like
    document-level style sheets, except that you don't put the
    definition(s) inside a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag.  Instead, you
    reference the file using the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag in the
    <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, the same place you would use the
    <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag.  Suppose we create a file called
    <code>my-style.css</code> that contains the following:</p>
<pre><code class="css">em { 
   color: red; 
   background: white;
}</code></pre>

<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;and we reference it in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; like this:
</code></pre>
<p></p><pre><code class="html">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="my-style.css"&gt;</code></pre></p>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;As with document-level style sheets, we can just use the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag
normally from then on.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

      &lt;h2 id="syntax"&gt;Syntax of a CSS Rule&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Your &lt;em&gt;Head First HTML and CSS&lt;/em&gt; book has a good graphic for explaining the
      syntax of a CSS rule:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figure class="text-center"&gt;
        &lt;img class="img-thumbnail" src="CSS1-files/CSS-rule-syntax.png" alt="explanation of a CSS rule"&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Explaining the syntax rule. Appears in pg. 259 of your book.&lt;/figcaption&gt;          
      &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;There are several facets to the syntax of a CSS rule:

  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;

      &lt;li&gt;The style &lt;em&gt;properties&lt;/em&gt; (such as &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt;) are followed by
      a colon, then at least one space, then the value of the property (such
      as &lt;code&gt;red&lt;/code&gt;).  &lt;!--The only properties we've learned so far
      are &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;background&lt;/code&gt; (which is a
      shorthand for &lt;code&gt;background-color&lt;/code&gt;), but we'll learn more
      soon.  The discussion of fonts will cover font properties such
      as &lt;code&gt;weight&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;size&lt;/code&gt;, for example.--&gt;  If you
      want to specify more than one property/value pair, separate them with
      semi-colons.  If there's only one property/value pair, the semi-colon
      is optional.  (Many people put it in just in case they add another
      property/value pair later.) The order of the style properties does
      not matter.

      &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For an in-line style, simply state the style properties as the
      value of the &lt;code&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; attribute in the HTML tag. Remember to enclose
      the style properties within quotation marks.

      &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For either a document-level style sheet or an external style
      sheet, the name of the element (such as &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; or
      &lt;code&gt;em&lt;/code&gt;) that you are modifying goes first, then an
      opening brace, then the style properties, then a closing brace.
      In a CSS rule, the element to which we apply the style is known as the 
      &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;selector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. All tags can be selectors. However,
      we will see more ways to define selectors in the forthcoming material.
      Spaces and line breaks are ignored, so feel free to format this in
      a visually pleasing way.  As always, clear and consistent
      indentation is very helpful for any reader of your styles.

      &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Document-level style sheets require the enclosing
      &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, while external style sheets always omit
      the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag.

      &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;External style sheets and document-level style sheets use the
      same syntax for specifying the tags, properties and values, but the
      external style sheet &lt;em&gt;omits&lt;/em&gt; the beginning and ending
      &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags.  &lt;strong&gt;You'll have nothing in angle 
      brackets in an external CSS file.&lt;/strong&gt;

      &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CSS is a different language from HTML and therefore has a
      different comment syntax in both an internal and external style
      sheet.  For CSS, the comment characters are &lt;code&gt;/*&lt;/code&gt; to
      begin and &lt;code&gt;*/&lt;/code&gt; to end.  Thus, for an external style
      sheet, you might have:

  &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="css"&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>/<em> Written by the CS210 Faculty
   Decided on 7/19/2016 to make EM magenta
</em>/</p>
<p>em {
   color: magenta; 
   background-color: white;
} </code></pre>    </p>
<pre><code>  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

      &lt;h2 id="moreproperties"&gt;Some CSS Properties&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Now that you know how to write style sheets, let us see some properties that 
      you can use in these styles. One can style an element over many aspects: 
        &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;color of the text
        &lt;li&gt;background of element (color, image, origin, position, etc.),
        &lt;li&gt;the border that surrounds the element (its color, size, style, etc.), 
        &lt;li&gt;the box that surrounds the element (margin, padding, size, etc.) 
        &lt;li&gt;the text inside the element (alignment, spacing, direction, etc.)&lt;/li&gt; 
        &lt;li&gt;the font for the text of the element (font family, style, weight, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;

      and other aspects that sometime are specific to certain elements such as tables, lists,
      user interface elements, etc. We suggest that you refer to the 
      &lt;a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp"&gt;CSS Reference website&lt;/a&gt;
      for a listing and examples of all CSS properties.

      &lt;h2&gt;Examples&lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;div class="alert alert-warning"&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;In the following, we give several examples of properties that
          are very useful for styling elements. For pedagogical
          purposes, we're not providing the code as text that can be
          easily copied and pasted somewhere else. We believe that by
          typing the instructions on your own, you will learn the
          names and values of properties, as well as potential errors
          that occur when one types. We strongly suggest that you
          use &lt;a target="_blank"
          href="http://jsfiddle.net"&gt;jsfiddle&lt;/a&gt; to try out all these
          examples. Before entering the code, read our questions and
          try to predict the answer without running the code. Then
          check if you were right.  To use jsfiddle, enter the HTML
          code in the HTML box, the CSS code in the CSS box, and then
          click the button Run. There is no need to write a whole HTML
          file, only the snippets shown in the examples. Also, to see
          the effect of styling, the text in HTML elements doesn't
          have to be meaningful as in our examples.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;h3&gt;Example 1&lt;/h3&gt;

      &lt;figure&gt;
        &lt;img class="img-thumbnail"
             src="CSS1-files/example1_opacity.png"
             alt="example for color and opacity"&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Using color and opacity.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

      &lt;h3&gt;Questions for Example 1&lt;/h3&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;In the rendered result, is the background color blue? Why
        not? What about the color of the text nested
        in &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;? Why it is not white like the rest?
        What does this tell about the order in which rules are
        applied?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;hr&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Example 2&lt;/h3&gt;  
    &lt;figure&gt;
        &lt;img class="img-thumbnail" src="CSS1-files/example2_text.png" alt="example for text and list properties"&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Styling for text and lists.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

    &lt;h3&gt;Questions for Example 2&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try first to predict how this code will be rendered. What is the effect of each rule on every element?
      How will the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; nested in &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; look like? Then, enter this
      code in &lt;em&gt;jsfiddle&lt;/em&gt; to see whether you were right in your predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;hr&gt;
</code></pre>
<div style="display: none">
          <h3>Example 3</h3>
          <figure>
            <img class="img-thumbnail" src="CSS1-files/example3_background.png" alt="example for background and border">

        <p>The URL for the background image was generated with the <a href="http://goo.gl/">Google URL shortener service.</a></p>
        <h3>Questions for Example 3</h3>

          <p>What do you see when this code is rendered? What happens when
          you comment out the rule for
          <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>? Can you add styling for
          the <code>border-bottom</code> property?  What happens when you
          replace <code>border-top-</code> with <code>border-</code>
          (keeping the rest unchanged)?  What happens when you change the
          value for <code>text-align</code> from center to right? Finally,
          add this style <code>border: 3px solid red;</code>
          to <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> and see what happens. This is an
          example of combining values for several properties in one
          style.</p>
</div>

<pre><code>      &lt;h2 id="cascading"&gt;Cascading&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;CSS has &lt;q&gt;cascading&lt;/q&gt; in the title because there's a
        strict hierarchy that determines which specification applies
        if the style of a particular tag is set in more than one
        place.  Suppose you specified the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag
        as (1) green in an external style sheet, (2) blue in a
        document-level style sheet and (3) red in an inline style.
        Which wins?&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The simple answer is that the &lt;em&gt;closest&lt;/em&gt; specification wins.
        This makes sense, because you can use the more local specifications
        to &lt;em&gt;override&lt;/em&gt; the more distant, global specifications.  So, inline
        style attributes beat document-level sheets, and document-level sheets
        beat external style sheets.

        &lt;p&gt;Furthermore, properties from enclosing elements can be inherited by the
          elements inside them.  Notice how, in one of the examples,
          the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element inside
          the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element inherits its properties.

        &lt;p&gt;If you'd like all the technical details of the cascade, you
        can check the specifications
        of &lt;a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1/#the-cascade"&gt;cascade
        order&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The process of resolving all the conflicting CSS rules is
        called the &lt;em&gt;cascade&lt;/em&gt;.  The &lt;em&gt;Head First HTML and
        CSS&lt;/em&gt; book has a detailed description for cascades on pages
        457-465. That description is pretty intimidating, though. In
        practice, the rules are pretty intuitive: the rule that is
        closer and more specific wins.

        &lt;h2&gt;Which Style Sheet to Use?&lt;/h2&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;One of the most common rules of thumb for creating clear and
        beautiful documents is &lt;em&gt;consistency&lt;/em&gt;.  For example, section
        headers should always be the same size, weight and font.

        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can best achieve consistency by specifying the style far
        enough from the text so that the style is specified in just one place.
        If you have a single web page that you would like to be consistent, you
        should use a document-level style sheet. If you have several web pages
        (a web &lt;em&gt;site&lt;/em&gt;) that you want to be consistent, you should
        definitely use an external style sheet.  Even if your website is only
        a single web page but you think you might someday have a second web
        page using the same style, you should use an external style sheet. In
        short, always use an external style sheet.

        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this course, you and a partner will be creating a website
        for a client.  For that website, you should define an external style
        sheet.  Then, if you or your client decides that &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
        should be centered, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; should be bold and blue,
        &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; should be underlined and non-bold, and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
        should be pink, you can do that in one place.  If you later change
        your mind and decide that &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; should be purple, you make
        one change in one file and all of your website is consistently and
        instantly changed.  If you had used the local style technique, you
        would have to edit every page of your site, searching for and
        modifying each occurrence.  This is tedious and error prone.

        &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;div class="alert alert-danger"&gt;
        &lt;strong&gt;We recommmend that you use external style-sheets as often as possible.
          Document-level style sheets can be used occasionally, but you should avoid as
          much as possible inline styling.
        &lt;/strong&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="caches">Caches</h2>

<p>One of the great advantages of external style sheets is also, for a web
  developer, a slight bother.  To understand that, you have to understand
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)"><em>caches</em></a>.

<p>The
word <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cache">&ldquo;cache&rdquo;</a>
(pronounced &ldquo;cash&rdquo;) is an ordinary, but uncommon, English word
(more of an SAT word for most people).  However, it's used all the time by
computer scientists because caches are used all the time by computers, in
all kinds of ways, because caching is a general technique for <em>speeding
things up</em>.

<p>In particular, your web browser will <em>cache</em> (keep a copy of) an
  external style sheet in a folder on your local machine (that folder is
  called, of course, the <em>cache</em>).  If the web browser needs that
  style file again, say on another page of your site that uses the same
  external style file, the browser doesn't have to re-download the file;
  it just grabs a copy from the cache. This makes the web browser faster.

<p>So, why is the browser cache a problem for a web designer?  Because if
  you make a change to the external style sheet, the web browser may
  continue to use the old cached copy, instead of getting the new improved
  copy from the server.  This means that when you view your page, you
  won't see your changes &mdash; very frustrating.

<p>The solution is to tell the web browser to ignore the cache when you
  re-load the page.  In most web browsers, this is done by holding down
  the shift key when you click on the <em>reload</em> icon.

<p>So, just remember:
  <blockquote><p><strong>When in doubt, use shift+reload</strong></blockquote>


           <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>

            <p>The idea of CSS illustrates an important concept in the field of
            computer science, namely <em>abstraction</em>.  Abstraction is the
            idea of saying what you want done without saying how to do it.  By
            leaving out the details about how to do something, you allow for some
            flexibility, so that you can revise your method of doing the task
            without messing up anything that depends on that task being
            done. Here, we said <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> without saying what that meant,
            putting elsewhere the specification of how to emphasize.</p>


          <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger">
            <h2 id="accessibility">Footnote: Colors and Accessibility</h2>
            <p> Since 
            <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> stands for emphasis, what could be better emphasis
            than putting something in red? Unfortunately, using color to convey meaning is, in fact, a
            <em>terrible</em> idea, because some people are color-blind or even
            completely blind.  Fortunately, we are (1) still using the EM
            tag, so screen-reading software will know to emphasize this
            text, and (2) still using the default italic font-style, so
            color-blind readers will still have a visual cue. 

            <p>We'll talk more about the issue of <a
            href="http://webaim.org/intro">accessibility</a> as the need arises
            throughout this course.  You should <em>always</em> think about
            accessibility when you are designing a web page, because you want your
            page to be readable by anyone, not only by people with the same
            physical abilities, browser software, computer display, and network
            bandwidth that you have.  Some websites are <a
            href="http://webaim.org/intro#standards">legally required</a> to be
            accessible. However, for the purposes of this lecture's examples,
            let's suppose that using red is a sensible thing to do.</p>

            <p>Note also that red text printed to a black-and-white
            printer comes out light gray, which <em>de-</em>emphasizes
            it. To address that, we could use a media query and have a
            special CSS rule for printing EM elements. We'll learn about
            media queries later.

<!-- Feb 2014: Eni made significant changes to introduce the new web fonts
which make away with the problem of not having fonts installed in your own computer.-->

        Reading: We strongly suggest you read chapter 8
        of <em><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596159924.do">Head

          <h2 id="fonts">Traditional Fonts</h2>
          <p>One of the most important aspect of a page that can be controlled with CSS
          is the <em>font</em>.    
            A font is a
            collection of <em>pictures of letters</em>. A <q>letter</q> is some
            kind of Platonic ideal, like perfect circles or archetypal chairs.  It's
            also a unit of <em>information</em>.  Any particular letter is drawn by
            some person.  Some are simple block letters, others are works of art 
            (like medieval illuminated manuscripts).  A font is a
            collection of these pictures, one for each character in the character set.
        </p>

          <p>Fonts are studied in the field of <em>typography</em>, and their study is
          outside the scope of this course. If you are interested in their history and technique
          you should take the <em>ART 222: Introductory Print Methods</em> course offered
          by the <a href="http://www.wellesley.edu/lts/collections/bookarts">Book Arts program</a>.

          </p>

<pre><code>      &lt;p&gt;For many years, fonts in web pages were restricted by the fonts that came 
        already pre-installed in a computer. This didn't allow for a lot of variety in styling. 
        This changed with CSS3 and the introduction of &lt;em&gt;web fonts&lt;/em&gt;, which don't need to 
        be installed in one's computer. Furthermore, with the use of the Google Fonts API it is 
        very easy to incorporate such fonts in a website, as we will demonstrate in these notes.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Read the suggested chapter 8 in &lt;em&gt;Head First HTML and CSS&lt;/em&gt; for a more detailed 
        account on styling fonts. In the following, we give a very concise summary.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;h2&gt;Font Properties&lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;There are systematic ways in which fonts can be characterized:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;ul&gt;

          &lt;li&gt;Font-families: serif, sans-serif, monospace, etc.  
          Serifs are the little marks at the end of
          the strokes of a letter. Along the baseline, they are horizontal, and
          can help guide your eye along the line.  Some fonts have them, some
          don't.  ("sans" is French for "without.")  Times is a serif font;
          Arial is sans-serif.

          &lt;li&gt;Font names: Verdana, Arial and Geneva are all sans-serif fonts, yet
          they look different: they are different &lt;em&gt;fonts&lt;/em&gt;.  Each
          font is the creative product of some artist or foundry.

          &lt;li&gt;Style: some fonts are upright or &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt;, others are
          slanted with a little extra curliness that we call &lt;em&gt;italic&lt;/em&gt;.
          Some font artists define several styles for their font families.

          &lt;li&gt;Size: fonts might be 10 point, 12 point, or many other &lt;a
          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/fonts.html#font-size-props"&gt;font
          sizes&lt;/a&gt;.  (A point is 1/72nd of an inch.)  Some fonts simply scale
          the "design size," so, for example, 12 point is simply 20 percent
          larger than 10 point.  Other fonts modify the scaling for artistic
          beauty.  You can also use seven abstract "absolute" sizes (they
          specify elements of a table of font sizes kept by the browser) named:

            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li style="font-size: xx-small"&gt;xx-small
              &lt;li style="font-size: x-small"&gt;x-small
              &lt;li style="font-size: small"&gt;small
              &lt;li style="font-size: medium"&gt;medium
              &lt;li style="font-size: large"&gt;large
              &lt;li style="font-size: x-large"&gt;x-large
              &lt;li style="font-size: xx-large"&gt;xx-large
              &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;You can also use abstract &lt;q&gt;relative&lt;/q&gt; sizes named &lt;q&gt;larger&lt;/q&gt; and
          &lt;q&gt;smaller,&lt;/q&gt; that are relative to the surrounding font.

          &lt;li&gt;Weight: The designer may produce variant fonts with thicker or
          thinner lines. Fonts with thicker lines are often called &lt;em&gt;bold&lt;/em&gt;.

      &lt;/ul&gt;

      &lt;h2&gt;Examples&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In the following we show two examples of using different font families for 
            the elements &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Notice
            how the text changes when the second rule is added.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;h3&gt;Example 1&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;figure class="text-center"&gt;
          &lt;img class="img-thumbnail" src="fonts-files/font1.png" alt="code to show font styling"&gt;            
          &lt;img class="img-thumbnail" src="fonts-files/result1.png" alt="result of applying font styling"&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Applying a font to the element &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;

      &lt;hr&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;Example 2&lt;/h3&gt;      
      &lt;figure class="text-center"&gt;
          &lt;img class="img-thumbnail" src="fonts-files/font2.png" alt="code to show font styling"&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;img class="img-thumbnail" src="fonts-files/result2.png" alt="result of applying font styling"&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Adding a font for the element &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

      &lt;h2 class="the_line"&gt;Optional Reading&lt;/h2&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Beyond here is optional reading for the interested
      student. The material is well within your abilities, and you're
      encouraged to read it, but it is not required.

      &lt;h2 id="webfonts"&gt;Web Fonts&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;As we mentioned, with traditional fonts that come pre-installed in our machines, we have
         only a limited number of choices (since the fonts need to be installed in the machine of the 
        viewers of the page too, not only your own). 
        However, with web fonts (supported by all modern browsers) there are new ways to deliver fonts
        (either by having your files as part of your website, or by linking to other web servers)
        so that everyone can see the pages with the font we intended. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Be aware that not all fonts on the Web are free. For some of them you need to pay.
        Thus, it is better to start your search with one of the services that aggregate fonts that are
        free for use. Such a website is &lt;a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/"&gt;Font Squirrel&lt;/a&gt;,
        from which you can download the fonts you like. Suppose after browsing the available fonts,
        you decided to use the handdrawn font &lt;a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Desyrel"&gt;Desyrel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figure class="text-center"&gt;
          &lt;img class="img-thumbnail" src="fonts-files/desyrel.png" alt="screenshot from Font Squirrel site"&gt; 
          &lt;figcaption&gt;A screenshot from the FontSquirrel website showing the page for the Desyrel font.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Clicking on the &lt;q&gt;Download TTF&lt;/q&gt; button, you can get the file with the font (after unzipping),
            &lt;code&gt;desyrel.ttf&lt;/code&gt;. Then, you can create a subfolder &lt;code&gt;fonts&lt;/code&gt; in the folder
            where your HTML and CSS files are stored and then use this font as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="css"&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>@font-face {
       font-family: desyrel;
       src: url("fonts-files/desyrel.ttf") format("truetype");
       font-weight: normal;
       font-style: normal;
}</p>
<p>p {
       font-family: desyrel, cursive;
       font-size: xx-large;
}
</code></pre></p>
<pre><code>          &lt;hr&gt;  
              &lt;p id="desyrel"&gt;This sentence was written with the &lt;em&gt;Desyrel&lt;/em&gt; font, downloaded from 
              FontSquirrel.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;hr&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, things are not so simple. Because there are so many browsers and platforms, to make
            sure that all of them will display the desired font, we will need to provide the font in many
            different formats (Chapter 8 in your book explains these formats). Thus, the rule for 
            &lt;code&gt;@font-face&lt;/code&gt; will look a bit more complicated. The good news is that this 
            code and all the files can be automatically created for you by 
            &lt;a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/"&gt;Font Squirrel&lt;/a&gt;, using its menu for 
            &lt;em&gt;WebFont Generator&lt;/em&gt;, after you upload the file &lt;code&gt;desyrel.tff&lt;/code&gt; (or some other font). 
        Here is how the automatically generated CSS will look like:&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="css"&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>@font-face {
    font-family: 'desyrelregular';
    src: url('desyrel-webfont.eot');
    src: url('desyrel-webfont.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),
         url('desyrel-webfont.woff') format('woff'),
         url('desyrel-webfont.ttf') format('truetype'),
         url('desyrel-webfont.svg#desyrelregular') format('svg');
    font-weight: normal;
    font-style: normal;
}
</code></pre></p>
<pre><code>      &lt;p&gt;Notice that the files are referred directly, and you might need to add the relative path
            to the folder you'll be storing these files.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;If this looks like a lot of work, there is an easier way, that doesn't involve having
            to keep the font files on our own server, we explain this method in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;h2 id="googlefonts"&gt;Google Fonts API&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The easiest way to incorporate fancy fonts in your pages is to use the free service provided
            by &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started"&gt;Google Fonts API&lt;/a&gt;. API stands for Application Programming Interface. With
            this method, you only need to perform a few simple steps:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;ul&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;Find fonts that you like from the list of &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/fonts"&gt;Google Fonts&lt;/a&gt;
                , and click the button &lt;q&gt;Add to Collection&lt;/q&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;On the bottom part of the browser, in the Collection tab, click on the button &lt;q&gt;Use&lt;/q&gt; and
              verify your choices.&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;Copy the provided &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; code from &lt;q&gt;Step 3&lt;/q&gt; to your HTML file (it goes
              in the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; section).&lt;/li&gt;
              &lt;li&gt;Add the CSS code from &lt;q&gt;Step 4&lt;/q&gt; to the CSS rules you want.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;You're done. Google takes care of providing all needed format files, you don't have to
            provide such formats as part of your website.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Here is an example of the code you need to write to create the shadowed header below:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; line goes into the HTML file:&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="html">
  &lt;head&gt;
    ...
    &lt;link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Wallpoet' rel='stylesheet' &gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
</code></pre>

<pre><code>            &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;font-family&lt;/code&gt; style goes in the CSS file (inside the rule for the desired element):&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="css">
  h2 {
      font-family: 'Wallpoet', cursive;
      font-size: 200%;
      color: black;
      text-shadow: 4px 4px 4px gray;
}
</code></pre>

<p><hr>
<div>
<style scoped>
      @import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Wallpoet);</p>
<pre><code>   #wallpoet {
  font-family: 'Wallpoet', cursive;
  font-size: 200%;
  color: black;
  text-shadow: 4px 4px 4px gray;
  }
</code></pre>
<p></style>
<h2 id="wallpoet">This header uses Wallpoet from Google Fonts</h2>
</div></p>
<p>The font was created
    by <a href="https://profiles.google.com/punktlars/about">Lars Berggren</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="at-import">Putting fonts into your CSS File</h2>

<p>The previous code works fine, but if you have a dozen pages in your
site, and you want to use Wallpoet in all of them, every one of those
pages would have to have the <code>link</code> tag in the
<code>head</code>. That is a lot of redundancy and is contrary to our goal
of stating the CSS information once in the shared external CSS file.

</p>

<p>What we can do instead is, in the Google Fonts browser, instead
      of using the default <code>link</code> code, switch to the <em>@import</em> tab.

<!--
        <figure>
          <img src="fonts-files/at-import2.png" alt="the CSS tab in Google Fonts">
          <figcaption>the CSS tab in Google Fonts</figcaption>
        </figure>
-->

</p>

<p>In that tab, you'll find code like this (it's the same URL as in the link):

    <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="css">@import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Wallpoet);</code></pre>

</p>

<p>Copy/paste that into your shared CSS file, and you'll be able
    to use Wallpoet in any file that uses that CSS file.

</p>

<h2>Google Fonts can break HTML Validation</h2>

<p>When you use several Google Fonts for a page, the URL generated by
Google contains the operator <code>|</code> to separate the different
fonts. HTML doesn't like such special characters, thus, your page will not
deemed valid by the W3 validator.  To fix this issue, you should replace
the character <code>|</code> with <code>%7C</code>.

</p>

<p><h2 id="choosing">Choosing a method</h2>   </p>
<p>We showed here three different ways of styling fonts and that can be confusing at first. 
    Here are some tips for you to decide what to use:

</p>

<ul>

    <li>If the website you are building is simple and you feel overwhelmed by the choices 
            we provided, stay with traditional fonts.

    <li>If you want a more sophisticated look for your website (maybe for a book or music band), get
        familiar with how to use Google Fonts API.</li>

    <li>If your website needs a particular kind of font that Google dosn't provide, learn how to 
        incorporate Web Fonts by using the services provided by the FontSquirrel website. 
        Chapter 8 of your book is required reading in this case.</li>          
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p>Keep in mind that your choice must be informed by the needs of the
 website you're building. Is the font important to convey something
 particular about the nature of the website? If the answer is yes, then
 you should make all the efforts to learn the advanced techniques we
 described.</p></div>

<h1>Accessibility</h1>
<p>A website is <em>accessible</em> if it can be used effectively by people who have
disabilities, such as blindness, deafness, or paraplegia.  We've mentioned
accessibility many times in this course, and we've made it an important
part of the way we build web sites. This reading will cover a lot of what
we haven't yet covered, though we won't be able to cover everything we
would like to.</p>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Overall, the web has been good for accessibility. Because the text is
already in computer form, it can be easily processed by a screen reader
for the blind (as opposed to print, which would first require optical
character recognition). Nevertheless, many modern websites can be
frustratingly difficult for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>We can assume that the designers who made the inaccessible websites didn't
set out to do so. Most of us see the need and responsibility for building
designers to allow for wheelchair ramps and curb cutouts to allow access
to public buildings, along with braille signs in elevators and many other
accommodations. Furthermore, the <a href="https://www.ada.gov">Americans with Disabilities Act or
ADA</a> requires that many websites be accessible in the
same way that public buildings must be accessible.  See the website <a href="http://webaim.org/">Web
Accessibility in Mind</a> for much more
information. Much of what is covered in this reading is drawn from that
resource. Their materials are copyright &copy; 1999-2016 WebAIM (Web
Accessibility in Mind).</p>
<h2>The POUR Principles</h2>
<p>Having decided to build an accessible website, we have to figure out what
that means. First, consider different kinds of disabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual: people can be blind, have low-vision, be color-blind, and more</li>
<li>Auditory: people can be deaf or hard of hearing</li>
<li>Motor: people can be unable to use a mouse, be slow or lack fine motor control</li>
<li>Cognitive: people can have learning disabilities or poor ability to focus</li>
</ul>
<p>To make a website accessible, we want to keep four guidelines in mind:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Perceiveable</dt>
<dd>The information should be accessible by the visitor's working senses, so, for example, information should not be presented solely by sound (a video with narration but no captioning).</dd>

<dt>Operable</dt>
<dd>The website shouldn't require the use of a mouse in order to access the information</dd>

<dt>Understandable</dt>
<dd>The content is clear, at least to the target audience.</dd>

<dt>Robust</dt>
<dd>The website should be accessible to a wide range of assistive technologies</dd>
</dl>

<p>These make the acronym POUR.</p>
<h2>Checklist Dozen</h2>
<p>These are wonderful principles, but our task in this reading is to see how
to achieve them.  Let's start with a list of the dozen most important
principles. I've copied this list from the WebAIM website, and I've
included links to their elaboration on each principle. You're encouraged
to go to their site to learn more.</p>
<dl>
        <dt><a href="http://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/">Provide appropriate alternative text</a></dt>
        <dd>Alternative text provides a textual alternative to non-text content in web pages. It is especially helpful for people who are blind and rely on a screen reader to have the content of the website read to them.</dd>

        <dd>Headings, lists, and other structural elements provide meaning and structure to web pages. They can also facilitate keyboard navigation within the page.</dd>
        <dt><a href="http://webaim.org/techniques/tables">Provide headers for data tables</a></dt>
        <dd>Tables are used online for layout and to organize data. Tables that are used to organize tabular data should have appropriate table headers (the <code>&lt;th</code>&gt; element). Data cells should be associated with their appropriate headers, making it easier for screen reader users to navigate and understand the data table.</dd>
        <dt><a href="http://webaim.org/techniques/forms">Ensure users can complete and submit all forms</a></dt>
        <dd>Ensure that every form element (text field, checkbox, dropdown list, etc.) has a label and make sure that label is associated to the correct form element using the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> element. Also make sure the user can <a href="http://webaim.org/techniques/formvalidation/">submit the form and recover from any errors</a>, such as the failure to fill in all required fields.</dd>
        <dt><a href="http://webaim.org/techniques/hypertext">Ensure links make sense out of context</a></dt>
        <dd>Every link should make sense if the link text is read by itself. Screen reader users may choose to read only the links on a web page. Certain phrases like &quot;click here&quot; and &quot;more&quot; must be avoided.</dd>
        <dt><a href="http://webaim.org/techniques/captions/">Caption and/or provide transcripts for media</a></dt>
        <dd>Videos and live audio must have captions and a transcript. With archived audio, a transcription may be sufficient. </dd>
        <dt>Ensure accessibility of non-HTML content, including <a href="http://webaim.org/techniques/acrobat/">PDF files</a>, <a href="http://webaim.org/techniques/word/">Microsoft Word</a> documents, <a href="http://webaim.org/techniques/powerpoint/">PowerPoint</a> presentations and <a href="http://webaim.org/techniques/flash">Adobe Flash</a> content.</dt>
        <dd>In addition to all of the other principles listed here, PDF documents and other non-HTML content must be as accessible as possible. If you cannot make it accessible, consider using HTML instead or, at the very least, provide an accessible alternative. PDF documents should also include a series of tags to make it more accessible. A tagged PDF file looks the same, but it is almost always more accessible to a person using a screen reader.</dd>
        <dt><a href="http://webaim.org/techniques/skipnav/">Allow users to skip repetitive elements on the page</a></dt>
        <dd>You should provide a method that allows users to skip navigation or other elements that repeat on every page. This is usually accomplished by providing a &quot;Skip to Main Content,&quot; or &quot;Skip Navigation&quot; link at the top of the page which jumps to the main content of the page.</dd>
        <dt><a href="http://webaim.org/articles/visual/colorblind">Do not rely on color alone to convey meaning</a></dt>
        <dd>The use of color can enhance comprehension, but do not use color alone to convey information. That information may not be available to a person who is colorblind and will be unavailable to screen reader users.</dd>
        <dt><a href="http://webaim.org/techniques/writing/">Make sure content is clearly written and easy to read</a></dt>
        <dd>There are many ways to make your content easier to understand. Write clearly, <a href="http://webaim.org/techniques/fonts/">use clear fonts</a>, and <a href="http://webaim.org/techniques/semanticstructure/">use headings and lists appropriately</a>.</dd>
        <dt><a href="http://webaim.org/techniques/javascript/">Make JavaScript accessible</a></dt>
        <dd>Ensure that <a href="http://webaim.org/techniques/javascript/eventhandlers">JavaScript event handlers</a> are device independent (e.g., they do not require the use of a mouse) and make sure that your page does not rely on JavaScript to function.</dd>
        <dt>Design to standards</dt>
        <dd>HTML compliant and accessible pages are more robust and provide better search engine optimization. <a href="http://webaim.org/techniques/css/">Cascading Style Sheets</a> (CSS) allow you to separate content from presentation. This provides more flexibility and accessibility of your content.</dd>

<p>This list does not present all accessibility issues, but by addressing these basic principles, you will ensure greater accessibility of your web content to everyone. You can learn more about accessibility by browsing our <a href="http://webaim.org/articles/">articles</a> and <a href="http://webaim.org/resources/">resources</a>. </p>

<h2>Images</h2>
<p>There are generally two kinds of pictures on a website: informative and
decorative. If a picture is informative, you <em>must</em> provide some way for a
blind user to get equivalent information in a textual form.  The usual way
to do this is to provide an ALT attribute on the image:</p>
<div>
<div class="example">
    <img src="/images/harry-potter-thumb.jpeg"
         alt="Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter">
</div>
<pre class="example-code">
    &lt;img src="/images/harry-potter-thumb.jpeg"
         alt="Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter"&gt;
</pre>
</div>

<p>Note that this ALT is often incorrectly called an "alt tag" but of course
it's an attribute not a tag. The general concept of providing a textual
alternative is called "alt text," so that's probably the easiest and best
way to describe this.  Also, the alt text doesn't say "picture of ..."
because that will be clear from the screen reader.</p>
<p>However, sighted people won't (typically) read this alt text. Maybe the
text preceding this image says that Daniel Radcliffe plays Harry Potter,
but a better way to do this would be to use a FIGURE and a CAPTION:</p>
<div>
<div class="example">
    <figure>
        <img src="/images/harry-potter-thumb.jpeg" alt="">
        <figcaption>Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<pre class="example-code">
    &lt;figure&gt;
        &lt;img src="/images/harry-potter-thumb.jpeg" alt=""&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
</pre>
</div>

<p>In this case, the screen reader software can use the caption as the ALT
text, so we explicitly leave the ALT attribute empty, so that the blind
visitor isn't read the same text twice.</p>
<p>This figure with a caption is now better for both blind and sighted
visitors, an example of where accessibility can improve the experience for
everyone.</p>
<p>What about other uses of images, say with slideshows and galleries?  In
most cases, a similar approach will work: if the sighted visitor is
expected to get some information from the picture, you should provide that
same information in textual form. A gallery of pictures showing the
executive board of your club, should have each person described with a
caption. If the pictures are somewhat generic, it's reasonable to give a
common caption ("picture from our annual soccer game") that will apply to
all the pictures in the slideshow.</p>
<p>If a picture is purely decorative (a picture of a soccer ball on the page
describing the annual soccer game), the ALT text can be explicitly set to
the empty string.  Alternatively, you can make the image be a background
image using CSS:</p>
<div>
   <style scoped>
   #soccerball {
      width: 240px;
      height: 240px;
      background-image: url(/images/240px-Soccer_ball.svg.png);
   }
   </style>

   <div id="soccerball"></div>
   <pre>
   #soccerball {
      width: 240px;
      height: 240px;
      background-image: url(/images/240px-Soccer_ball.svg.png);
   }

   &lt;div id="soccerball"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</div>

<p>The advantage of a background image is that, using media queries, you can
easily omit these decorative images when the screen size is small.</p>
<h2>Videos and Audios</h2>
<p>Video and audio elements pose the same issues as still images. Blind
visitors won't be able to see your video, so it should have a textual
transcript. Deaf visitors won't be able to hear the narration or speakers,
so the video should have captioning.  This is not always easy or
inexpensive. However, there is a benefit that search engines will be able
to do a better job with indexing this content if the textual equivalent
exists.</p>
<h2>Hyperlinks</h2>
<p>We already know that hyperlinks shouldn't have "here" or "more" as the
click text. Screen readers often read links out of context, so the link
text should stand on its own. However, there's a lot more to know about
hyperlinks. Here are just a few items:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>People expect that links are underlined. Unless the context makes the
  link obvious (a navigation bar), don't use CSS to remove the default
  underline</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An image that is a hyperlink will use the ALT text as the description of the hyperlink.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't say "link to X" or "go to Y"; the screen reader will indicate that the element is a hyperlink</p>
</li>
<li></li>
</ul>

Golden Rules for
Developers]{https://www.sitepoint.com/15-rules-making-accessible-links/}.</p>
<h2>Labels for Form Controls</h2>
<p>Each form control (input element, such as a text input or a menu)
needs to have a label. It can be tempting to omit the labels when you
have placeholders and such, but labels are necessary.</p>
<h2>Avoid Color</h2>
<h2>Non-HTML Content</h2>
<h2>Skip Links</h2>
<h2>Standards</h2>
<h2>Accessible JavaScript</h2>
<ul>
<li>don't use mouseover, mouseout and hover, since those are mouse-only</li>
<li>use :focus for links that are in focus</li>
</ul>
<h2>Accessible jQuery</h2>
<p>Many jQuery methods, such as <code>.hide()</code> and <code>.slideUp()</code> use the CSS
setting <code>display:none</code> to achieve the hiding. That method means the
resulting content is inaccessible to a screen reader.  If you don't
want that, a better idea is to add an after-event handler to the
jQuery code to display the content but offscreen (or using one of the
other techniques for hiding content).</p>
<h2>Accessible Drop-down Menus</h2>
<h2>Accessible Slideshows</h2>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Assistive software and hardware are always evolving, as are the CSS
techniques that attempt to help them while not hindering other
visitors. The main thing is to consider accessibility when you are
considering coding some fancy new interface: will it work if the user only
has a keyboard? will it work if the user is blind? Will it work if the
user has limited motor control? Sometimes, this will mean foregoing that
fancy feature, but the goal of making our website for all instead of the
lucky few is worth the price.</p>
