<h1>Navigational Structures</h1>

<p>Let's look now at some of the standard navigational structures of web
pages. As the name suggests, a site's navigational structure describes the
paths of navigation through the site. When thinking about these
structures, keep in mind that while some sites consist of only a single
page, most &quot;real&quot; websites consist of many pages. In most
websites with more than just a few pages, you will see a combination
of several of these structures.

<h2>Linear and Circular</h2>

<P> <img id="linear" src="linear.gif" alt="linear and circular navigation" width="462" height="74">

<UL>
  <LI>Follows pre-defined path
  <li>Links to NEXT and PREV
  <li>Examples: Slide Show, Tour or Presentation
</UL>

<h2>Hub and Spoke</h2>

<p><img id="hubspoke" src="hubwheel.gif" width="241" height="199" alt="hub and spoke navigation">
  
<ul>
   <li>Central navigation hub with many links
   <li>Other pages only have one "back" link, hence no navigation overhead
   <li>Example: CS110 syllabus page links to each lecture page
</ul>

<h2>Clique</h2>

<!-- made this slightly smaller than its natural size so that -->
<!-- it will fit better on the printout -->

<p><img src="clique.png" alt="clique navigation" width="256" height="256" id="clique">

<ul>
   <li>Every page connects to every other page
   
   <li>No special "navigation" page

   <li>Quickest to get around in, but every page must have all N links on it
   <li>Adequate for small sites but unwieldy for larger
     sites
   <li>Example:  the top level of the CS110 site
</ul>

<h2>Rooted Tree</h2>

<p><img id="tree" src="tree.gif" alt="tree navigation" width="252" height="178">

<ul>
  
  <li>The structure is &quot;self-similar&quot;. It has a root web page that has  subtrees
    as its branches. Each subtree is a root with subtrees. 
  <li>Very modular, conceptually clear
  <li>Separate subareas aren't connected
  <li>Works well for big sites
  <li>Examples: Yahoo!<!--, parts of CS110 site (assignments, project, administration)-->
</ul>

<h2>Network or Graph</h2>

<p><img id="netleft" src="networkleft.gif" alt="network navigation, left half" width="196"
height="138"><img id="netright" src="networkright.gif" alt="network navigation, right
half" width="194" height="210">

<ul>

   <li>Interconnections on a somewhat <span style="font-style: italic">ad hoc</span> basis

   <li>A page might be connected to a number of other pages (based on logical content of pages on site)

   <li>Can be too random; hard for visitors to understand   
   <li>Almost necessary for a large site
   <li>Examples:  Wellesley College Website

</ul>

<h2>Project Considerations</h2>

<p>Your project should consist of 8-10 pages.  You should make sure to
  discuss with your partner how your web pages are linked to make
  navigation easy and logical for visitors. In the project design phase
  you are required to describe the interconnection of all the pages on
  your site and provide a brief discussion about the site's navigation
  structure using the terminology learned today.
