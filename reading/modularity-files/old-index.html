<h1>Modularity in Websites</h1>

<div id="insert_TOC_here"></div>

<h2 id="big-picture">Modularity: The Big Picture</h2>


<p>Today, we'll be looking at several ways to make your website more
<em>modular</em> &mdash; i.e., created out of <em>reusable</em>
parts that make the website easier to <em>maintain</em>. 

<h3>Reusability</h3>

<img id="modularity_logo" src="modularity-logo.png" alt="modularity logo">

<p><q>Reusability</q> has become one of the watchwords of the environmental movement,
and for good reason. Reusing objects that have taken much time, energy, and other resources
to create is eminently sensible. 

<p>Reusability makes a lot of sense in the programming world, too. 
Suppose that a programmer has spent a lot of time developing code that 
solves a problem. This code can often be reused by the same
programmer in a different program, or by other programmers in their programs. 

<p>In JavaScript, we've seen that functions are a good way to make code reusable.
Once code is encapsulated in a function, that function can be invoked in many 
different contexts. 

<p>Groups of related functions and data structures are often collected
together in reusable units called <em>modules</em> or <em>libraries</em>
that are used by large communities of programmers.  These play an
important role in the adoption of programming languages.  Languages like
Java, C/C++, Fortran, and Python have become popular in large part because
of the impressive modules/libraries that have been built for these
languages.  jQuery is a library that makes JavaScript programming easier.

<p>Modules are particularly reusable when they have been designed to be
used in mix-and-match ways &mdash; think Legos, standard parts from a
hardware store, USB peripherals, mix-and-match clothing, etc. That's the
idea behind the logo at the top of this section.  Crafting a module that is
easy and useful to reuse is more art than science, but it's a worthy goal.

<p>As a concrete example with web pages, suppose that you've figured out how
to make a beautiful navigation bar for one page in a website. You'd like a way to 
package up your navbar code into some sort of module that you can reuse
on other pages for the same site, and perhaps for pages in other sites. 
What you <em>don't</em> want to do is simply copy &amp; paste your navbar
code into other pages, because that's a nightmare to maintain. 
Which brings us to the topic of ...

<h3>Maintenance</h3>

<p>What is maintenance and why is it important?  We all know what, say,
car maintenance is:  changing the oil, keeping the tires inflated, fixing
stuff that breaks.  It keeps your car running better and longer.  But that
doesn't have anything to do with web sites, since they don't have physical
parts that wear out.

<p>But they do need to be changed and updated from time to time, which
computer scientists have come to call <q>maintenance.</q>  Countless
studies have shown that, over the lifetime of a software project, about
two-thirds of the overall cost is in maintenance.  Surprising, but true.
You may not be maintaining your cs110 project, but someone will, and we
should make their job easier.

<p>You're already doing some of the most important steps:
<ul>
<li>keeping the HTML simple, neat and clean, which makes it easier to add
new content, and
<li>keeping the style information in a external style sheet, so that
stylistic changes to the site can be easily made in just one place.

</ul>

<p>The techniques we will see today are similar to the idea of an external
style sheet, because they allow us to put shared code in a single file
that is used by more than one page.  
This general idea is known by computer scientists as <em>modularity</em>: 
a <q>module</q> is any kind
of distinct, separable thing that can be used more than once.  
<!--
(The idea
is very abstract, so we're stuck with vague words like <q>thing.</q>)
Modules also allow greater <em>reusability</em>: even if the entire web
site is scrapped, one of its modules might be re-used in the new version,
or in several different sites.  
-->

<h2 id="js">JavaScript Code Files</h2>

<p>As we saw before (see <a
href="../JSfunctions/fruitfulFunc.html#JSfiles">JavaScript files</a>),
very often, you have some JavaScript code that you'd like to use on
several web pages.  The best example would be a collection of useful
functions, all stored in a single file.  You could have the browser load
the file of functions, and then your web page could invoke the particular
functions you want.  Let's look at some examples.

<h2 id="accessibility-bar">Accessibility Bar</h3>

<p>The top of this page features a set of font sizes formatted in various
sizes, where clicking on them changes the font-size for this page to the
selected size.  We're calling this the <q>accessibility bar</q> (like a
navigation bar, but with accessibility controls).  All the code is in a
separate file, so the only thing we had to do to put the accessibility bar
on this page was the following:

<pre class="sh_html">
&lt;script src="accessibility-bar-jq.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>Let's look at the contents of
  the <a href="accessibility-bar-jq.js">accessibility-bar-jq.js</a> file.

<p>Some key things to look at and think about are:
  <ul>
    <li>How does JavaScript control and change style elements?  Could we
    make a control that would change, say, the thickness of the bar in the
    H2 elements?
      
    <li>Why didn't we supply a stylesheet along with the accessibility
      bar?  Why did we instead supply a separate stylesheet,
      namely <a href="accessibility-bar.css">accessibility-bar.css</a>?
        
    <li>What functions are parameterized and what aren't?  Can you think
    of ways to make this accessibility bar more general and therefore more
    useful?
  </ul>

<div class="ex">
<h2 id="exercise-accessibility-bar">Exercise:  Accessibility Bar</h2>

<p>How flexible are the functions defined in the file above?  Could you
  easily use them to make just a pair of increase/decrease controls, omitting
  all the other controls?  How?
  
</div>


<h2 id="taxes">Tax Rate Functions</h3>

<P>Another example is some JavaScript that processes a form. Here's an example:

<div class="form">
  <form id="tax_form" action="/cgi-bin/dump.cgi" method="get">
    <p>What is the bill? <input type="text" name="bill">
    <p>tax: <input type="text" name="tax">
    <p>total: <input type="text" name="total">
    <p><input type="submit">
  </form>
</div>

<script src="tax-calculations.js"></script>
<script>
function newbill() {
    var bill = parseFloat($("#tax_form [name=bill]").val());
    var tax = calculateTax(bill);
    var total = bill+tax;
    // store into the form
    $("#tax_form [name=tax]").val(tax.toFixed(2));
    $("#tax_form [name=total]").val(total.toFixed(2));
}

$("#tax_form [name=bill]").change(newbill);
</script>

<pre class="sh_javascript">
  &lt;form id="tax_form" action="/cgi-bin/dump.cgi" method="get"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is the bill? &lt;input type="text" name="bill"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;tax: &lt;input type="text" name="tax"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;total: &lt;input type="text" name="total"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;input type="submit"&gt;
  &lt;/form&gt;
...
&lt;script src="tax-calculations.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>The JavaScript code associated with this form is the following:

<pre class="sh_javascript">
function newbill() {
    var bill = parseFloat($("#tax_form [name=bill]").val());
    var tax = calculateTax(bill);
    var total = bill+tax;
    // store into the form
    $("#tax_form [name=tax]").val(tax.toFixed(2));
    $("#tax_form [name=total]").val(total.toFixed(2));
}

$("#tax_form [name=bill]").change(newbill);
</pre>

<p>(The <code>change()</code> method is an event that happens whenever the
  value in the form changes.)

<p>As you've probably guessed, the <code>taxRate</code> variable and the
<code>calculateTax</code> function are defined in the external JavaScript
file, <a href="tax-calculations.js">tax-calculations.js</a>.  

<p>The latter part of this example assumes that the form, in addition to
the <code>bill_amount</code> input, also has inputs named
<code>tax_amount</code> and <code>total_amount</code>.  When the user
fills out the bill amount, the JavaScript code calculates the other two.
It puts the values into form inputs so that they can be sent to the CGI script
if desired.

<p>The <code>calculateTax</code> function is defined in the
<code>tax-calculations.js</code> file.  (The
function <code>calculateTax</code> uses the programming concept
of <em>return values</em>, which we haven't covered, but don't worry about
that.)  One nice effect of this technique is that if the tax rate changes
(say, the state legislature declares a tax holiday), we can change the
definition of the function in that file, and any web page that uses the
file will immediately start using the new definition.

<p>Of course, you could get the effect of an external file of JavaScript by
including the JavaScript code using SSI, but that requires more processing
by the server, so this way is better.

<div class="ex"><span class="ex">Exercise 1</span>

<p>Download the files for the bill example, and then change the tax rate
or change the <code>calculateTax</code> function, say by having it
complain if the bill amount is negative.  You can do this without knowing
about <code>return</code>.
  
</div>

<h2 id="improved_modularity">Improved Modularity</h2>

<p>First of all, notice that the file of JavaScript could be a collection
of random, unrelated, and disorganized code.  There's nothing in this
mechanism to enforce any kind of conceptual organization to the JavaScript
code.  You could simply have one file, say <code>mystuff.js</code>,
and put anything you want in it.

<p>That would work, but it has the disadvantage that you probably will
end up loading code you don't need (a small drag on page loading
time). More importantly, it's harder to find the code you want and to keep
things organized.  Instead, you could divide your code into conceptually
coherent groups. For example:

<pre class="sh_html">
&lt;script type="text/JavaScript" src="date-functions.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/JavaScript" src="form-validation.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/JavaScript" src="rollovers.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/JavaScript" src="lightbox.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>These files are more worthy of the term <em>module</em>.  If someone
asks to use your <q>lightbox</q> code, you can point them to that file,
and they won't have to wade through irrelevant stuff to use your code.

<p>(Unfortunately, dividing your code into several small files increases
  the loading time of your website, since the browser needs to make a
  separate connection for each one.  Therefore, professional web designers
  use tools to combine a bunch of modules into one file, thereby getting
  the best of both worlds.)

<h2 id="protection">Protecting Your Implementation</h2>

<p>Suppose you're the one who implemented the
<code>tax-calculations.js</code> module above, and other web designers
are using your code on their websites.  You know that the variable
<code>taxRate</code> is the rate that we pay, and so can anyone reading
your code.  However, you worry that someone might mistakenly or
maliciously set that variable to the wrong value.  They could set it to
0.50 instead of 0.05, or even set it to a non-numerical value.

<p>One thing you could do is provide a programmatic way to set the tax
rate, rather than just assigning to the variable.  For example, something
like this:

<pre class="sh_javascript">
function setTaxRate (newRate) {
    if( isNaN(newRate) ) {
        alert("Error: the new value is not a number: "+newRate);
    } else if( newRate < 0 ) {
        alert("Negative Tax Rates don't make sense");
    } else if( newRate > 0.3 ) {
        alert("This tax rate is higher than any legal rate "+newRate);
    } else {
        taxRate = newRate;
    }
}
</pre>

<p>Then, people set the tax rate using this function, instead of just
assigning to the variable <code>taxRate</code>.  Of course, this function can't check for every
possible error, but it could be a help.

<p>But, you object, a malicious person could still set the
<code>taxRate</code> variable directly, instead of using this function.
That's true.  However, there are programming techniques (which we won't go
into) that protect values absolutely, so that you <em>must</em> go through
a <q>setter</q> function like this in order to set the value.  Thus, our
module can build up walls around itself, controlling how it is used.

<p>Computer scientists endeavor to create programming languages that are
powerful, easy to use, and also encourage and enforce useful modularity.
This makes programming better and more effective.

<h2 id="headers-footers">Modularizing Headers and Footers</h2>

<p>Suppose we have three pages, A, B, and C, all of which should share a
  common header (with banner image and navbar) and common footer.

<p>We would like to be able to describe these pages in such a way that we
<em>generate</em> the shared parts so that they are easy to change.  For
example, to add a new menu item or footer item, we should only have to
change <em>one</em> piece of code, not code on <em>each</em> of the pages.

<h2 id="ssi">Modularity via Server-Side Includes</h2>

<p>We have already studied one way to achieve this sort of modularity: 
<strong>server-side includes (SSI)</strong>. You might want to refresh 
your memory by reviewing the <a href="../SSI">SSI notes</a>.

<h2 id="modularity-js">Modularity via JavaScript Functions</h2>

<p>Another way to achieve the modularity we desire in the A, B, C example
is to use JavaScript functions to generate the shared HTML code in 
each file. 

<p>As shown below in the HTML source code for <code>A.html</code>, we can 
accomplish this using the JavaScript functions <code>addHeader()</code>
and <code>addFooter()</code>. (The code for <code>B.html</code>
and <code>C.html</code> is exactly the same except for a different content
paragraph.)

<pre id='pageA' class="sh_html">
</pre>

<p>The file <a href="js/header-footer.js">header-footer.js</a> contains
definitions of
<code>addHeader()</code> and 
<code>addFooter()</code>, which are responsible for generating the HTML
elements that are shared between all the pages. 

<pre id="hf" class="sh_javascript">
</pre>

<p>Any change to the functions <code>addHeader()</code>, 
<code>addBannerPic()</code>, 
<code>addNavbar()</code>, 
<code>addMenuItem()</code>, 
and <code>addFooter()</code> 
will affect all of the web pages in the website. 
For instance, it's easy to add a new menu item to the menu bar
or a new icon to the footer list.

<p>See the <a href="js/header-footer-example.html">header-footer example in
action</a>
