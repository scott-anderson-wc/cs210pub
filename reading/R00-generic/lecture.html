<h2>Usability</h2>

  <p>This semester, we've learned the nuts and bolts of web design: HTML,
  CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, and more. You also recall that, early in
  the semester, we had a class discussion about about <em>design</em>-what
  makes good design, what makes bad design, and why. This falls generally
  under the umbrella of <em>usability</em>, or user-centered design, which
  means, according to
  <a href="http://www.usability.gov/">usability.gov</a> designing your
  website so that users can effectively, efficiently and satisfactorily
  achieve their goals. We return to that topic today, which is
  particularly important as we prepare for testing your websites.

<h3>Schneiderman's Eight Golden Rules of Usability</h3>
<p>Usability isn't an easy thing to master. There's no magical formula that you can follow to make your site user-friendly. There 
  are, however, some guidelines that will make your site much easier for your users. These rules are based off of user interface 
  design (such as interactive applications), but can easily be adapted to 
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Strive for Consistency</strong> - Keep your design consistant across pages. Users will be confused if your website 
      follows one design pattern on one pages and another design pattern on another page. Keep your navigation bar, the way your 
      links look, your text size, etc. consistant.
    <li><strong>Cater to Universal Usability</strong> - Your website should be easy for people of all ability levels to use. 
    <li><strong>Offer Informative feedback</strong> - If your website has interactive elements, such as form submission or an AJAX 
      back-end, make sure to inform the user what your interface is doing. Has the form been submitted? Has the information been 
      saved successfully? If you were the user, what would you like to know?
    <li><strong>Design Dialogs to yield closure</strong> - This rule is more important for user interfaces than for more static 
      sites, but still applies in situations like in Rule #3.
    <li><strong>Prevent Errors</strong> - This is one of the hardest to master. It involves stepping through the process that 
      users take to achieve tasks on your website, and thinking about where on your site users might become confused. User testing 
      can help illuminate some of these problems. 
    <li><strong>Permit easy reversal of actions</strong> - Don't let a user get lost on your website. Make it easy for them to get 
      back to whatever page they came from.
    <li><strong>Support internal locus of control</strong> - This rule is similar to Rule #6. Make sure your users always know where 
      on your website they are located. A map of the sequence of clicks taken to reach their current page 
      (i.e. "<em>About/Our Story/The Beginning</em>"), or "breadcrumbs", are helpful in achieving this.
    <li><strong>Reduce short term memory</strong> - Don't make your users remember information from page to page. If your site has 
      a page that requires users to use information from another page, put all of the information together instead of making your 
      user jump back and forth between pages.
  </ol>

<h3>More Usability Suggestions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Make sure you don't have broken links!</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Make the most important information easiest to find</strong><br><img src="eyetracking.jpg" alt="eye tracking study">
      <br>Eye tracking studies (shown above) conducted by Jacob Neilsen show that users read in an F-shape, the first two 
      paragraphs are the most important, and sub-headings and lists stand out from paragraph text.
    <li>On a similar note, <strong>Provide a hierarchy of information</strong> - Use headers, lists, and breaks to make information 
      easier to find and read.
    <li><strong>Use White Space</strong> - One of the most common web design follies is to try to fit as much information on a 
      page as possible. In fact, the opposite should be true. More white, or blank, space looks better and makes sites easier to 
      read.
    <li>And last but not least, <strong>test for usability</strong> - You become so intimately familiar with your site in the process 
      of making it that you might miss problem areas for users simply because they seem obvious to you. Often you won't know about 
      usability issues until your test subjects find them for you.
  </ul>

  <em>Side note: One of the most important things about usability testing is to inform the test subject that you are testing the 
    <span class="underline">system</span> not <span class="underline">them</span>, and that any confusion or issues they have is valuable 
    information to you. Your usability test won't be effective if the test subject is nervous because they feel they are being 
    judged on how well they use your site!</em>

<h2>What is Responsive Web Design?</h2>

  <p>Responsive web design is certainly one of those things that falls under the umbrella of usability, but is so important that 
    it deserves its own section. Making a website "responsive" means <em>designing your website so that it is adaptable and 
    accessible to users on any device</em>.

  <p>Think of the multitude of devices out there today: computers with large-screen monitors, big laptops, small laptops, tablets, 
    e-readers, phones, and many more. If users from any of these devices cannot get the information or achieve the tasks they need, 
    your website loses a lot of effectiveness. The below chart shows the growth of mobile phone use in accessing the Web.

  <p><img src="mobile.jpg" alt="the rise of mobile web access">

  <p>And that's just <em>phones</em>.

  <h3>What does a responsive website look like?</h3>

  <p>Well, it's much easier to show what a non-responsive website looks like. For example, the CS110 Schedule page is not responsive:

  <p><img src="non-responsive.png" alt="the cs110 schedule page">

  <p>You'll see that at smaller screen widths, the user cannot see the whole schedule at once, which is a problem in and of itself. But 
    you'll also see that because the menu on the side is fixed, it overlaps the menu when you try to scroll sideways to see the rest of 
    the
    schedule. The <a href="http://spigotdesign.com/">spigotdesign.com</a>
    site, however, is designed to be responsive.  Try visiting the site
    and re-sizing your browser.  The following image shows what the site 
    looks like on a computer, on a tablet, and on a mobile phone.

  <p><img src="spigot.png" alt="a responsive web site">

  <p>Elements have been adjusted in size, moved, and even taken away entirely to adapt for different screen sizes. There are really no 
    hard-and-fast rules for making a website responsive. Much of the process of responsive web design involves designing for big screens, 
    testing for different screen widths, and then adjusting your site accordingly. There are, however, some helpful guidelines for 
    designing for smaller screens.

  <h3>Guidelines for Designing For Smaller Screens (Tablets, E-Readers, Phones, etc.)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Resize your content to fit on the screen.</strong> - If your content does not fit horizontally, stack it vertically, 
        since there is often more vertical space than horizontal space on these types of devices.
      <li><strong>Remove non-essential content</strong> - There is some content that users simply may not need when they are browsing 
        on-the-go. Do not be afraid to remove it if it is taking up valuable screen space.
      <li><strong>Increase font size for legibility</strong> - It's already difficult to read on mobile devices. Increase the font 
        size to make your site easier to read.
      <li><strong>Make your links and buttons recognizable and clickable</strong> - On touchscreen devices, users are using their fingers 
        to click on links instead of a mouse or trackpad, which can be much less accurate. Increase the size of your buttons and links 
        to account for this.
      <li><strong>Whitespace is still important</strong> - Resist the urge to fill the screen space since there is so little of it. As with 
        before, this blank space is still important for the overall readability of your site. Increase your margins and padding, if need be.
    </ul>

<h2>How do you adapt for responsiveness?</h2>

  <p>In order to adapt your website to different screen widths, you first must determine your screen's width, then apply certain rules to 
    your screen under those circumstances. This is done with a <em>media query</em>. A media query is like an <code>if</code> statement in 
    JavaScript: if your screen is within a certain range, then apply the CSS rules.

  <h3>Example</h3>
  <p>Resize your brower window (by clicking and dragging with your mouse) to see the block change color.
  <div class="colorblock"></div>

  <pre>
    .colorblock {
        width: 100%;
        max-width: 850px;
        height: 30px;
        background-color: red;
      }

      @media screen and (max-width: 700px) {

        .colorblock {
          background-color: blue;
        }

      }

      @media screen and (max-width: 500px) {

        .colorblock {
          background-color: green;
        }

      }
  </pre>

  <p>Notice that:

    <ol>
      <li>The media queries comes after the original CSS definition. This is so that the later rules can overwrite the previous ones.
      <li>Only the rule in question (in this case, the background color) is changed. All the other original rules still apply.
    </ol>

  <p>In the example above, 700px and 500px become special numbers. In the web design world, these are called <em>breakpoints</em>, 
    since they are screen widths where things on the page change. In general, it is good to have as few breakpoints as possible - it 
    can be confusing if things are constantly changing when you resize your screen, and difficult to maintain. Thereis a lot of debate 
    in the web design world about the best breakpoints for your media queries, but, generally, safe bets are 768px and 480px, the screen 
    widths of an iPad and an iPhone.

<h2>Other Responsive Fixes</h2>

  <p>On another note, you'll notice that the div itself is responsive and resizes along with the screen. This is because we gave it a 
    100% width and a max-width of the largest pixel size we want our element to be. This is a great trick for making images responsive; 
    if you check, you'll see that all the images on this page are. Percentage widths are one of your biggest tools in making a site 
    responsive; instead of fixed-pixel widths, use percentages of the screen size. Other tricks include:

    <ul>
      <li>Remove things using <code>display: none</code>
      <li>Set inner elements to be percentage widths of outer elements (for example, four blocks in a row on the page to each have 
        25% width, adding up to 100% width in total)
      <li>Load lower image resolutions as narrower screen widths
      <li>Arrange things vertically instead of horizontally, by switching from <code>display: inline</code> or 
        <code>display: inline-block</code> to <code>display: block</code><br>
        <em>Side note: display: inline-block is a neat CSS rule we didn't talk about in class. It allows elements to act as block elements 
          in terms of size and containing other elements, but is treated like an inline element for display purposes, allowing it to 
          line up side-by-side with other inline elements.</em>
    </ul>

    <p>Besides that, just try things! You'll never know what works until you spend some time finding out what doesn't first.

<h2>Example: Let's Fix the CS110 Schedule</h2>

<p>Here's a <a href="div-divs.html">responsive version of the CS110
    schedule</a>. Try resizing your browser, then read the explanation.

  <p>Here's a <a href="div-divs-fancy.html">fancier responsive
  version</a>, which automatically generates day labels in the narrow
  version.

<h2 id="exercise1">Example: Let's Adapt a Page to be Responsive</h2>
Start with <a href="responsive-practice.html">this non-responsive page</a>, and use media queries to make it adaptive to smaller 
screens. Your solution may look something like <a href="responsive-practice-solution.html">this page</a>.

<h2>XCode</h2>
  <p>While shrinking your browser down to 768px and 480px will give you a pretty good idea of what your website will look like on an 
    iPhone and iPad, it's not always a completely accurate representation. The best way to see how your site looks is to get your 
    hands on one of these devices, or to use a simulator. The best iOS simulator is actually made by Apple, and comes with Xcode, 
    Apple's free software development tool for Mac users. It can be found in the 
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835">Mac App Store</a>.

  <p>In order to use the Xcode device simulator, first launch the program. Then under <em>Xcode > Open developer tool</em> 
    launch the <em>iOS Simulator</em>. This will bring up a simulation iPhone, which you can use exactly like a normal iPhone.
  <p><img src="xcode1.jpg" alt="launching xcode">
  <p>If you would like to see your website on an iPad or another iOS device, you can change it under <em>Hardware > Device</em> and 
    select the device you wish.
  <p><img src="xcode2.jpg" alt="switching devices">

<h2>More Resources</h2>
<p>You're probably thinking by now, <em>Wow, this sounds like a lot of code!</em> But don't be afraid! There are tons of frameworks on the 
  Web that make creating responsive websites easy. Most of these are built on something called a <em>fluid grid</em>, which, in most 
  cases, takes care of the responsiveness for you. One of my favorites, and an industry standard, is <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">
  Bootstrap</a>, a framework built by two software developers at Twitter. If you plan on continuing in web design after this class, 
  or if you're just interested, check it out.
