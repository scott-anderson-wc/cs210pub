<h1>The Host</h1>

The Host is a demon who runs a Los Angeles karaoke nightclub frequented by
demons.  He has some psychic powers and often helps put our heros on the
right path.  He's a recurring character who began in the second season of
Angel. We only recently learned that his real name is Lorne.

<p>The Host will return in <a href="../season3.html">Season 3</a>
