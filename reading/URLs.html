              <h2 id="absolute">Absolute URLs</h2>
          
          <div>
            URLs are used to specify the locations of resources in files on
            any computer in the world, so they can be a little complex.
            Taking as an example the URL of the page you are reading:
          </div>
          <p></p>
          <blockquote>
            <table class="table-bordered">
              <tr>
                <th>protocol</th>
                <th>server.domain</th>
                <th>path</th>
                <th>filename</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><code>https://</code> </td>
                <td><code>cs210.wellesley.edu</code></td>
                <td><code>/reading/</code></td>
                <td><code>URLs.html</code></td>
              </tr>
            </table>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>let's break it down in its components:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><code>http://</code>&nbsp;This is the protocol, which is
            almost always HTTP, the HyperText Transfer Protocol, or HTTPS,
            its secure counterpart. You'll occasionally see FTP and
            others.</li>
            
            <li><code>cs210.wellesley.edu</code>&nbsp; This is
             the <em>server</em>: a machine connected to the internet that
             hands out files to anyone who asks. <code>cs210</code> is the
             name of the machine;
             <code>wellesley.edu</code> is the domain. The name of the
             server combined with the domain must be <em>unique</em> in
             the <em>world</em>. In fact, the domain must be unique in the
             world, and the server name must be unique within the
             domain.</li>
            
            <li><code>/reading/</code>&nbsp;This is the
             <em>path</em>: a sequence of directories (AKA folders),
             separated by slashes, that indicates where on the server the
             file is located. Here there is only one folder, but there
             could be several.</li>
          
            <li><code>URLs.html</code>&nbsp;This is the file that is being
            requested.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Because URLs can specify files on many different kinds of
            computers, you should stick to a lowest common denominator when
            naming your directories and files, to avoid confusing machines and
            browsers. The lowest common denominator means:
            
          <ul>
            <li>use letters and digits, but no special characters like /, *,
            #, &amp;, and so forth</li>
            <li><strong>no spaces</strong> (this is the most common error for Mac and PC
            users). For example, if you want to have a web page named
            <code>cats and dogs.html</code> you're much safer
            with <code>cats-and-dogs.html</code> or
            <code>cats_and_dogs.html</code></li>
          
          </ul>
          
          <p>Furthermore, be careful with upper and lower case. To your eyes,
          <CODE>cats.html</CODE> and <CODE>Cats.html</CODE> may seem like the
          same filename, but to a computer, they're as different as
          <CODE>cats.html</CODE> and <CODE>dogs.html</CODE>. The same rule is true
          of directory names: they are case-sensitive. Many people like to stick to
          all lower-case, just so they don't have to remember. </p>
          
          <p>Certain parts of the end of an absolute URL can be omitted.
          For example, the filename can be omitted and (usually) defaults
          to a file named <code>index.html</code> in the specified
          directory (for an example, see
          our <a href="http://cs210.wellesley.edu/">course
          homepage</a>). Similarly, the path can be omitted, in which case
          the page is in the <q>top</q> directory of the web server.
          However, <em>the protocol and server must be specified</em>. You
          can't omit those.  If a URL has a protocol, it's an
          <strong>absolute URL</strong>, otherwise it'll be treated as a 
          <strong>relative URL</strong>.</p>
            
            
          <h2 id="trees">Tree Structured Directories</h2>
          
          <p>As you know, most operating systems (including Mac, Windows, Unix, iOS, Android, etc.),
            organize the contents of a computer's hard drive into 
            <em>folders</em>, also called <em>directories</em>. Folders and files form
            a <q>tree</q> structure, because of the ability of directories to contain
            other directories.
            
            <p>Here's an example:
              <blockquote>
                For a website about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon">Joss Whedon</a>, 
                we might have a folder about his
                Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV show, another about the TV show Angel, and
                a document about his comics.  These might all be in a top-level folder
                called <q>Joss</q>.  (The top-level folder is also called
                the <em>root</em> folder.) The folders about the TV shows might each have a
                sub-folder called <q>cast</q>.  And so on.
              </blockquote>
            
            <p>While it's easy to conceptualize a tree of folders and files, also
              called a <em>directory tree</em>, there are many different ways to draw
              it.  Here are several ways of depicting the <a href="Joss/">Joss directory tree</a>
              described above that you will see in this course:
              
            <figure>
              <img src="URLs-files/images/Joss-dirtree-hand-new.png" alt="Joss directory tree drawn by hand" 
                   class="img-thumbnail center-block">
              <figcaption>A hand drawing for the Joss Whedon website.</figcaption>
            </figure>
              
            <figure>
              <img src="URLs-files/images/Joss-dirtree-mac.png" alt="Joss directory tree on a Mac"
                   class="img-thumbnail center-block">
              <figcaption>The folder structure as displayed in Mac by <strong>Finder</strong>.</figcaption>
            </figure>
              
            <figure>
              <img src="URLs-files/images/Joss-dirtree-win.png" alt="Joss directory tree on Windows"
                    class="img-thumbnail center-block">
              <figcaption>The folder structure as displayed in Windows by <strong>Windows Explorer</strong>.</figcaption>
            </figure>
              
            <p>For example, we can see that <code>buffy.html</code> and <code>willow.html</code> are both
            files in the same directory, the one called <code>cast</code>, which is, in turn, one
            of three things in the directory called <code>Buffy</code>, which is in the directory
            called <code>Joss</code>. Joss contains two directories (Buffy and Angel) and a file
            called <code>comics.html</code> and so on. Take a minute to be sure you understand
            the relationships among the directories and files.  Notice that there
            are <em>two</em> files named <code>angel.html</code>; this is okay, because they
            are in different directories.</p>
          
          <H2 id="relative">Relative URLs</H2>

          <p>We can use these relationships to form a shorthand way of
          specifying a URL. This is called a <EM>relative</EM> URL, because we
          specify the location of a file relative to a known file. Here are the
          basic rules:
          
          <ol>
             <li>Relative URLs are only for files on the same server.
             Therefore, we can leave off the protocol and server name.
             
             <li>If a file is in the same directory as the HTML file containing
             the link, we just give its name.  If
             we want to put a link <EM>in</EM> the file <CODE>buffy.html</CODE>
             linking it to <code>willow.html</code>, we can say:
             
            <pre class="prettyprint">
              <code>&lt;a href="willow.html"&gt;her best friend Willow&lt;/a&gt;</code>
            </pre>
               
               <li>If a file is in a sibling subdirectory, we can just give the
               path starting from the sibling. So, if we are in the file called
               <code>mythology.html</code> and we want to give a link to the file
               <code>angel.html</code>, we can say:
               
            <pre class="prettyprint">
              <code>&lt;a href="cast/angel.html"&gt;Angel, the vampire with a soul&lt;/a&gt;</code>
            </pre>
               
               <li>If the file is in a directory that contains a subdirectory that 
               contains the HTML file with the link,
               we have to go <q>up</q> the tree. To go up, we
               write <code>../</code>. That's <q>dot, dot, slash.</q> For example, if we
               are in the file <code>host.html</code> and we want to make a link to
               <code>season3.html,</code> we can say:
               
            <pre class="prettyprint">
              <code>&lt;a href="../season3.html"&gt;the Host returned in season 3&lt;/a&gt;</code>
            </pre>
               
               That last step, with the <code>..</code> is tricky: to go up, we write
               <code>..</code>; while to go down we have to indicate which subdirectory
               we mean. In either case, we separate these up/down steps with a
               slash. Here's another example: suppose we want to put a link
               from <code>buffy.html</code> to <code>comics.html</code>. In this case,
               we can write:
            
            <pre class="prettyprint">
            <code>&lt;a href="../../comics.html"&gt;another layer in the comics&lt;/a&gt;</code>
            </pre>
               
          </ol>
          
          <h2 id="fragments">Fragments</h2>
          
          <p>The model above establishes a one-to-one correspondence
            between a URL and a file (web page) somewhere in the vast web.
            Sometimes, however, you want to address (point to) a
            particular location <em>within</em> a page. Such locations are
            called <em>fragments</em>.  Here is a link
            to <a href="#fragments">this section of this page</a>
            (actually the header of the section). Try it!</p>
          
          <p>While fragments can be used in many ways, one common use is to have
            a <q>table of contents</q> at the top of a page, allowing readers to skip
            down to the particular section they are interested in.  An example of
            such a table of contents is at the left side of these notes.</p>
          
          <p>Fragments are addressed by extending the URL by adding
            a <code>#</code> character and
            the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_id.asp">id</a>
            attribute of the fragment (the HTML element that we are
            referring to).  Thus, we have:</p>
          
          <p>
          <blockquote>
            <table class="table-bordered">
                <tr>
                   <th>protocol</th>
                   <th>server.domain</th>
                   <th>path</th>
                   <th>filename</th>
                   <th>fragment id</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                   <td><code>https://</code> </td>
                   <td><code>cs210.wellesley.edu</code></td>
                   <td><code>/reading</code></td>
                   <td><code>URLs.html</code></td>
                   <td><code>#relative</code></td>
                </tr>
            </table>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>One key step is marking the <em>destination</em> of the URL,
            by <em>naming</em> the fragment, just as we name a file or folder. This
            is done with the <code>id</code> attribute, which can be applied to
            every HTML tag.  We typically add it to the header tag (such
            as <code>h2</code>) of the section we want to skip to.  For example:
          
            <pre class="prettyprint">
            <code>&lt;h2 id="relative"&gt;Relative URLs&lt;/h2&gt;</code>
          </pre>
          
          <p>Given the code above, we can then point to that section from any web
            page anywhere, using an absolute URL, like the one in the table above.
            We can also use fragments with relative URLs.  For example, to point to
            that section from another file in the same directory, we can just give
            the filename and the fragment name: <code>URLs.html#relative</code>. In
            fact, if we want to point to it from within the same file, we can omit
            the filename and the relative URL becomes just <code>#relative</code>.
            You can see examples of that kind of URL in the table of contents on the 
            sidebar.
