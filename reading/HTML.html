<h2>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</h2>

<p>In this course, you will learn three languages, which play different
  roles in the implementation of a web page:

<ul>

   <li>HTML (HyperText Markup Language).  This language specifies
   the <em>structure</em> and <em>content</em> of a web page. You can
   think of it as the flesh and bones of a site.

   <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).  This language specifies
   the <em>appearance</em>, <em>presentation</em> or <em>style</em> of a
   web page. You can think of it as the clothes, though sometimes the
   metaphor of <q>skin</q> is used.

   <li>JavaScript.  This language specifies the <em>behavior</em> of a web
   page. If the page is dynamic or interactive, it's JavaScript that
   supplies the magic.
</ul>

<p>We will begin with HTML.
</div>

<h2 id="tags">HTML Elements and Tags</h2>

<p>An HTML document is composed out of <strong>elements</strong> that
begin and end with <strong>tags</strong>. For example, the <code>H2</code>
<em>tag</em> was used to create the <em>header</em> element you see above:

<blockquote>
<table class="display">
 <tr>
   <th><code>&lt;h2&gt;</code></th>
   <th><code>HTML Elements and Tags</code></th>
   <th><code>&lt;/h2&gt;</code></th>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td style="text-align: center; background-color:yellow;"><em>start tag</em></td>
   <td style="text-align: center; background-color:red;"><em>contents</em></td>
   <td style="text-align: center; background-color:cyan;"><em>end tag</em></td>
 </tr>
</table>
</blockquote>

<div class="new">
<p>Here's an example of a simple page; it's an excerpt of the <a
href="../lectures/L01/csfun/CSfun.html">CS fun</a> example that we saw

         &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
</div>


<p>The following are some HTML tags that you can see above. If you
forget what a tag does or are looking for a new tag, you can look up tags
in an <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/">HTML Reference</a>. (Note
  that we will <em>not</em> be learning all the tags in that reference;
  we'll learn a useful subset.) Some of the tags we've seen are:

<ul>
   <li>Structural tags like
   
   <ul class="compact">
      <li><code>&lt;html&gt;</code>
      
      <li><code>&lt;head&gt;</code>
      
      <li><code>&lt;title&gt;</code>
      
      <li><code>&lt;body&gt;</code>
   </ul>
   
   <li>Header tags are <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>&ndash;<code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>
   
   <li>Text tags like
   
   <ul class="compact">
      <li><code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
      
      <li><code>&lt;br&gt;</code>
      
      <li><code>&lt;strong&gt;</code>

      <li><code>&lt;em&gt;</code>

      <li><code>&lt;code&gt;</code>

      <li><code>&lt;q&gt;</code>
   </ul>
   
   <li>List tags:
   
   <ul class="compact">
      <li><code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>
      
      <li><code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>
      
      <li><code>&lt;li&gt;</code>
   </ul>

</ul>

<p>There are several other tags that you have seen, but still need to learn more
about.  
<ul>
   <li>The all-important anchor (hyperlink) tag: <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>

   <li>The image tag: <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>

   <li>Odd tags like <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code>
</ul>

<p>We'll learn more about these in this reading.

<p>Most elements have an end tag that matches the start tag. 
In a few special cases, particularly <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>
and <code>&lt;/li&gt;</code>, the end tag is optional and
may be omitted because the browser can determine it from context. 

<p>Some elements (such as <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>, 
<code>&lt;hr&gt;</code>, 
and <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>) consist only of a start tag
and do not have corresponding end tags or contents. 
These are called <strong>empty elements</strong>.

<p>Tags serve as instructions telling the browser how to 
display the contents of elements. The browser is an 
<strong>interpreter</strong> for HTML code; it reads
the HTML code and renders its elements based on rules
for each kind of tag. 

<h2 id="nesting">Nesting</h2>

<p>Multiple tags can be <em>nested</em>:  one
fits inside the other like measuring cups or Russian dolls.  If we
have two tags, <code>fred</code> and <code>barney</code>, they 
can be nested like this:

<pre>
&lt;fred&gt;
   <em>Region A</em>
      &lt;barney&gt;
         <em>Region B</em>
      &lt;/barney&gt;
   <em>Region C</em>
&lt;/fred&gt;
</pre>

<p>The <code>fred</code> tag applies to all three regions, <em>Region A</em>,
<em>Region B</em> and <em>Region C</em>, while <code>barney</code> applies only to
<em>Region B</em> that it surrounds.  The <em>Region A</em> and <em>Region C</em>
only have the <code>fred</code> tag apply to them.

<p>When nesting two tags, the inner tag must be closed before the outer tag
is closed. Your browser may not enforce this; it may be forgiving of errors,
but you can't be sure that every browser will be so forgiving, so
always follow this syntactic rule.

<h2 id="tag_syntax">Tag Syntax</h2>

<p>We learned that tags always begin with a left angle
bracket <code>&lt;</code> and close with a right angle bracket
<code>&gt;</code>. (Remember that the browser doesn't care whether the
tag's name is upper or lower case.) You can provide additional information 
within the tag to further specify what it does, using <em>attributes</em>.

<div class="new">

<h2 id="structural_tags">Structural Tags</h2>

<p>Web pages have a required structure, and so there are required
structural tags to mark the different parts. Each page has a HEAD and a
BODY, enclosed by tags with those names. These two parts are contained
within an HTML element. The HEAD contains information about the page, such
as its TITLE, so the HEAD requires the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element.
We'll learn more of these structural tags later.

<h2 id="header_tags">Header Tags</h2>

<p>Headers are just what you think they are: they're just like headings
  for chapters, sections, subsections and so forth in books, papers and
  other documents that you're used to. H1 is for things like chapters, H2
  for sections, H3 fo subsections, and so forth.

<h2 id="Text_tags">Text Tags</h2>

<p>Text tags are used for textual elements, such as creating paragraphs
  using the <code>&lt;P&gt;</code> tag, or emphasizing some text using
  the <code>&lt;EM&gt;</code> tag, and so forth.

<h2 id="List_tags">List Tags</h2>

<p>If we want to create a bullet list, we can use
  the <code>&lt;UL&gt;</code> tag, which stands for <q>unordered
  list</q>. This tag is just a <em>container</em>: it encloses a set
  of <em>list items</em>, each created by the <code>&lt;LI&gt;</code>
  tag. Thus, the following creates a list:
<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;apples
    &lt;li&gt;bananas
    &lt;li&gt;coconuts
  &lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>

<p>If you want the list items to be numbered automatically, you want
  an <em>ordered list</em>, which you can get with
  the <code>&lt;OL&gt;</code> tag.

</div>

<h2 id="hyperlinks">Hyperlinks (The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> Tag)</h2>

<p>A good example of the use of attributes is seen with the anchor
tag, <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>.  To use it as a hyperlink, you have to
specify where the link takes us. For example, to have a link that
says <q>Google</q> and takes us to <code>www.google.com</code>, we say:

<pre>&lt;a href="http://www.google.com"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

<p>The <code>href</code> part is the <em>attribute</em>.  For this tag,
since the attribute is almost always required, we can almost think of it
as an <code>a href</code> tag, but that way of thinking will confuse us
later, so it's best to think of it as two separate ideas.  Later, we'll
see other attributes for the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag.

<h3>Exercise 1</h3>

<div class="new">
<p>(Note: we will intersperse exercises like this in the reading. They are
  solely for your benefit. They are typically short and may help with
  understanding the concepts and techniques. They are not graded. We
  highly recommend that you make time for them.)
</div>

<p>To start this exercise, click on this link to <a target="_blank"
  href="http://jsfiddle.net/">JSFiddle</a>.  JSFiddle is an extremely
  popular <q>sandbox</q> that allows you to play with HTML, CSS and JS
  right in your browser, without having to launch an editor (such as
  TextWrangler), save files to your server, or any other such
  infrastructure. We'll use it a lot in this course.

<p>Copy/paste the following code into the HTML box of the JSFiddle. Then
  click the "Run" menu item to see the result.

<pre>
  &lt;p&gt;This is the text on my little page.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This is some additional, very boring, text on my page.&lt;/p&gt;

</pre>

<p>Then <strong>add an</strong> <code>h1</code> 
<strong> header and an </strong><code>h2</code> <strong>header</strong> 
to the page. 
<!-- , using one of the <code>H1</code>&ndash;<code>H6</code> header tags.-->

<p>Now <strong>put in a link</strong> to your favorite website. Here are some
of ours. (To see the URL where they go 
    hover over a link and look at the left-bottom bar of your browser.)

<ul>
   <li><A HREF="http://www.bostonmagazine.com/">Boston Magazine</A>
   
   <li><a HREF="http://www.imdb.com/">The Internet Movie Database</a>
   
   <li><a HREF="http://www.reelviews.net/">ReelViews: Movie
   Reviews and Criticism by James Berardinelli </a>

   <li><a href="http://www.snopes.com/">Snopes.com Urban Legends Reference Pages</a>
</ul>

<div class="new">
<h2 id="title">The <code>title</code> tag</h2>

<p>The contents of the <code>title</code> tag doesn't appear on the body
  of the web page (though it often appears at the top of the window in the
  title bar). It is, however, very important for two reasons:
  <ul>
    <li>It tells search engines what stuff is on the page.
      
    <li>It appears in menus when someone bookmarks a page or looks in
    their history. 
  </ul>

<p>For both those reasons, a page title like <q>about us</q>
  or <q>contact</q> is often not helpful. It's a good idea to put
  something more descriptive in the title, such as <q>About CS 110</q>
  or <q>CS 110 staff contact information.</q>
</div>

<h2 id="here_links">The <q>Here</q> Link</h2>

<p>Once, it was very popular on the web to have links like this:
  <ul>
    <li>Click <a href="http://google.com/search?as_q=apple+pie+recipes">here</a> for
    apple pie recipes
    <li>Click <a href="http://google.com/search?as_q=peach+pie+recipes">here</a> for
    peach pie recipes
    <li>Click <a href="http://google.com/search?as_q=prune+pie+recipes">here</a> for
    prune pie recipes
  </ul>

<p>It seemed so clever and intuitive, making the clickable text be the
  word "here."  There are two big problems with this, though:
  <ul>

    <li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: Screen-reading software for the
    blind often will read the text of the links on a page so that the user
    can easily navigate to other pages.  Links like those above read as
    "here," "here," "here" &mdash; useless.
      
    <li><strong>Indexing</strong>: Search engines pay special attention to
    the click text on a page, since those are often an important clue
    about the content of the destination page.  The links above don't show
    what the important words are.
  </ul>

<p>So what do you do instead?  Just wrap the link tags around important
  words:
  
  <ul>
    <li>Here are some <a href="http://google.com/search?as_q=apple+pie+recipes">
    apple pie recipes</a>.
    <li>Click here for <a href="http://google.com/search?as_q=peach+pie+recipes">
    peach pie recipes</a>.
    <li>Yo, check out the <a href="http://google.com/search?as_q=prune+pie+recipes">
    prune pie recipes</a>.
  </ul>

<p>Accessibility is very important in CS 110, so keep that in mind.

<h2 id="link">The LINK tag</h2>

<p>In the <code>head</code> element of each CS110 lecture page, you'll see 
some HTML that looks something like: 

<pre>
   &lt;link href="http://cs.wellesley.edu/~cs110/cs110-main-style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"&gt;
</pre>

<p>Like the anchor tag, the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag also has an
<code>href</code> attribute, and it also links one web page with another.
However, it has a different purpose.  Instead of producing a clickable
link, the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag tells the browser that there is
some additional information about this page located in a different file.
The <code>href</code> attribute of the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag tells
the browser where to find the other file.  The <code>href</code> attribute
contains a URL, which we'll learn about later.

<p>The <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag contains other attributes depending
on the purpose of the connection.  In our case, it contains: <ul>

   <li>a <code>rel</code> attribute that says what the RELationship
   the other file has to this one.  We use it to specify a
   <em>style sheet</em>, which says how tags should be formatted.

   <li>a <code>type</code> attribute that says what kind of stuff the
   other file contains.  In our case, we say that the file contains
   <code>text/css</code>. 

</ul>
        
<div class="alert alert-danger">In HTML5, the attribute <code>type</code> is not
        required anymore. The reason is that
        CSS is declared the default style for HTML5. However, you might see <code>type</code>
        in our older examples and in many pages on the Web. It is not an error to use it,
        but it's not required anymore.
</div>

<p>The <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag <em>can</em> be used for a variety of
purposes, but most current browsers only use it for style sheets.

<p>At this point, the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag is still a mystery.
We've told you what it's for, and something about its syntax, but not what
goes in the other file.  We'll learn more about the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>
tag, style sheets and CSS in later lectures.

<h4>Exercise 2</h4>

<p>Modify the JSFiddle from the previous exercise by adding the
following <code>link</code> element near the top.  (You'll get a minor
  complaint from JSFiddle, but you can ignore it.)

<pre>
&lt;link href="https://cs.wellesley.edu/~cs110/cs110-main-style.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
</pre>

<p>How does this affect the appearance of the document? 

<p>In the modified document, how can you change the appearance of an 
unvisited hyperlink from blue text to text that is large and green? 
(Hint: use a header tag.)


<h2 id="attributes">Tag and Attribute Syntax</h2>

<p>We can now generalize start tag syntax to include any number of
attributes, as follows:

<pre>
&lt;tag attr1 = "value1" attr2 = "value2" ... attrN = "valueN"&gt; 
   <em>contents</em>
&lt;/tag&gt;
</pre>

<p>Browsers differ on how nit-picky they are about attributes.  Many will
let you get away with omitting the quotation marks when the value is a
single solid word (no spaces in the value).  Others will complain if you
have line-breaks in your attributes.  In general, it's best to comply with
the strictest syntax rules, so that your site will work on the most
browsers.

<p>Note that some versions of HTML, namely XHTML, require attributes to be
in quotation marks.  We're using HTML5, which is much more liberal, and
will let you omit quotation marks unless the value contains a space, a
line break, grave accent (&grave;), equals sign (=), less than sign
(&lt;), greater than sign (&gt;), quote (&quot;) or apostrophe (&apos;).
In short, if there's anything confusing in the value, use quotation marks.
<!--For the purposes of this course, you may omit unnecessary quotation marks.
You'll find that your instructors aren't always consistent.-->

<h2 id="images">Using Images</h2>
         
<p>One thing that we all want to do with our web pages is add pictures.
Because the picture file is a separate file, we have to link to it, just
like the <code>href</code> attribute of the anchor
(<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>) tag.

<p>Once you have an image file, say <code>small_weasel.jpg</code> you can
use it on your web page like this:
         
<pre>
&lt;img src = "small_weasel.jpg" alt = "a small weasel"&gt;
</pre>
         
<p>with the following result:</P>
         
<blockquote><p><img src="small_weasel.jpg" alt="a small weasel" width=289 height=234></blockquote>
         
<p>Of course, this only works if the server can find the image file.
The <code>src</code> attribute must be
the <a href="URLs.html"><em>URL</em></a> of the image file. It can be an
absolute URL or a relative URL. What did we use here?
         
<p>When the browser asks for this page, the server sends it back and it
also finds and sends back any image files that the page references. If the
server doesn't find the file (or the file is corrupted in some way), the
browser will show this:
         
<blockquote><p><img src="small_weasel-not-found.jpg" alt="a small weasel"></blockquote>
         
<p>Depending on your browser, you may see a broken-image icon above, the
  <code>alt</code> text, or possibly nothing at all.

<h4>Exercise 3</h4>

<p>Modify the JSfiddle to display an image of the weasel. (Of course, you
could replace this image by any other image you'd like!)  Note that in
    this case, you <em>must</em> use an absolute URL for the IMG, namely:

<pre>
http://cs.wellesley.edu/~cs110/reading/small_weasel.jpg
</pre>

<p>Add a <code>title</code> attribute with value <code>"small weasel image"</code>
to the image.  What does this do? 


<h3 id="ALT">The ALT Attribute</h3>

<p>You noticed that we added an ALT attribute to the IMG tag that is a
small piece of text that can be used in place of the image in certain
circumstances.  The ALT attribute is an important part of the HTML
standard.  Perhaps its most important use supports
<em>accessibility</em>.  Unfortunately, not everyone has good enough
vision to see the images that we use in our websites, but that
doesn't mean they can't and don't use the Web.  Instead, they
(typically) have software that reads a web page to them, including
links.  When the software gets to an IMG tag, it reads the
ALT text.  If there is no ALT text, it may read the SRC attribute,
hoping there's a hint there, but all too often the SRC attribute is
something like <code>"../images/DCN87372.jpg"</code> and the visually 
impaired web user is left to guess.

<p>Therefore, you should always include a brief, useful value for the ALT
attribute.  If your page is an image gallery, then your ALT text could be
a description of the image.  However, describing the image is not, in
general, the idea.  For example, if the image is a link whose target is
made clear by the image, then the ALT text should say something like,
"Link to ..." so the user will know what to do with it.  The sole
exception is for images that are just used for formatting, such as blank
pictures that fill areas or colorful bullets for bullet lists.  In those
cases, in fact, it's better to include an ALT attribute that
is <em>empty</em>, so that the user doesn't have to listen to the SRC
attribute being read.  In both cases, the text should be useful for
someone who wants to use your site but isn't sighted.  It helps to turn
off images and view your site to check.

<p>Furthermore, you should avoid having critical information on your website
conveyed only in images.  There may be times when it is unavoidable, but
to the extent that it is possible, we want our websites to be easily
usable by all people, including the blind and visually impaired.

<p>Accessibility is important in modern society.  We build ramps as well
as stairs, we put cutouts in curbs, and we allocate parking spaces for the
handicapped.  Indeed, most federal and state government websites are
legally required to be accessible, and ALT attributes are just one part of
that.

<p>In this class, we expect you to always use the
ALT attribute. If you find an image or an example where we've forgotten to
use one, please bring it to our attention.

<p>For more information, you can read the following
<ul>

    <li><a href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/feature/art3.htm"> more thorough
    discussion of ALT </a>

    <li><a href="http://www.pantos.org/atw/35534.html">The Art of ALT</a>

</ul> 

<h3 id="aspectratio">Resizing and Aspect Ratio</h3>

<p>If you want to display a bunch of pictures, the web page appears neater if
the pictures align well.  You can align them vertically if they all have
the same width, or horizontally if they all have the same height.  For
example, the following three pictures are all 150 pixels high.

<blockquote>
<p>
  <img src="HTML-files/molehill.jpeg" alt="a molehill" height="150">
  <img src="HTML-files/eiffel-tower.jpeg" alt="the Eiffel Tower" height="150">
  <img src="HTML-files/matterhorn.jpeg" alt="the Matterhorn" height="150">
</blockquote>

<p>Regardless of the actual dimensions of an image, the browser will
squeeze it into a set size if requested.  You can do this with two new
attributes, namely <strong>HEIGHT</strong> and <strong>WIDTH</strong>:

<pre>
&lt;img src="..." alt="..."  height="<span style='font-style: italic'>height-goes-here</span>"   width="<span style='font-style: italic'>width-goes-here</span>"&gt;
</pre>

<p>Replace the "height-goes-here" and "width-goes-here" with integers
specified in <!--a href="../M01-color/index.html#pixel"--><em>pixels</em>,
which we'll discuss later.  If both width and height are specified, both
will be obeyed, but you have to be careful with that.  Suppose the
original image is 160x240: taller than it is wide.  Technically, the ratio
of the width to the height is called the <strong>aspect ratio</strong>.
The Eiffel Tower picture has an aspect ratio of 160:240 or 2:3.  If you
set the height and width so that they don't have the same aspect ratio,
the picture will look distorted. Here is the Eiffel Tower with the wrong
aspect ratio:

<blockquote>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
&lt;img src="eiffel-tower.jpeg" alt="the Eiffel Tower" width="300" height="150"&gt;
</pre>
<p><img src="HTML-files/eiffel-tower.jpeg" alt="the Eiffel Tower" width="300" height="150">
</blockquote>

<p>If you use <em>either</em> the HEIGHT or the WIDTH attributes, but not
<em>both</em>, the browser will usually calculate the other attribute so
that the aspect ratio is preserved.  Thus, the picture will have either
the width or height you want, but will not be distorted.  That's how we
did that row of pictures above.

<h4>Exercise 4</h4>

<p>Modify the JSfiddle to display an image of the Eiffel tower next to the
  weasel so that both images have the same height. You'll have to use an
  absolute URL for both images:

<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>

<p>From the very first computer program, programmers have needed to
leave <q>notes</q> in the code to help themselves and others understand
what's going on or what the code's purpose is.  These notes are called
<em>comments.</em> Comments are a part of the program text (they're
not written separately, because then, well, they'd get separated),
but they are ignored by the computer. Comments aren't about what someone 
can discover by reading the code, but should cover the background context 
of the code, or its goal.

<p>Because it's important to get in the habit of putting comments in your
HTML code, we will <em>require</em> comments in this course. At this
point, you won't have a lot to say, and that's fine.  You will start by
labeling each file with its name, your name, the date, and any sources you 
consulted (such as the source code of other web pages).  Think of this as
signing your work.  Later, when you're designing a website with many
coordinated pages, you can use comments on a page to talk about how it
fits into the overall plan. 

<h2 id="html_comments">HTML Comment Syntax</h2>

<p>The HTML comment syntax is a little odd-looking.
<!-- because it doesn't have any letters in it.  -->
Here's an example:

<pre>&lt;!-- I can say anything I want in a comment.  --&gt;</pre>

<p>The syntax starts with a left angle bracket <code>&lt;</code> then an
exclamation point and two hyphens, then the comment (anything you
want) and ends with two hyphens and a right angle bracket <code>&gt;</code>.
<!--You can see other examples of comments by viewing the source of this
web page (select View/View Source in Safari or Tools/Web Developer/Page Source 
in Firefox).-->

<!-- Do HTML comments nest properly? Lyn checked, but unclear from documentation -->

<h2 id="beauty">Beauty in Websites</h2>

<p>Ah, but you object that your web page looks <em>ugly</em> without
centering, font changes, colors, and so forth.  That may be; we're not
going to try to contradict your aesthetic sense.  However, for the first
week of this course, we don't want to confuse anyone by introducing style
sheets right away.  So, we ask you to be patient.  We will get to style
sheets very soon.</p>

<p>In the meantime, consider the fact that many visitors to your site
might not gain any advantage from style sheets anyway, because they are
visually impaired, or because they are using an old or alternative browser that
doesn't honor style sheets.  For such users, the most important thing is
the <em>content</em> and having that content well-structured and clearly
conveyed.  So, until we get to style sheets, consider that you are
designing your website with accessibility in mind.

<h2 id="debugging">Bugs and Debugging</h2>

<p>An HTML document may contain many different kinds of errors
that prevent it from rendering as you expect. 
Errors in code are known as <strong>bugs</strong>, and the process
of finding and correcting such errors is called 
<strong>debugging</strong>. 

<p>Here are some common types of HTML bugs:

<ul>

<li> a tag name is misspelled/wrong, such as <code style="color:red;">&lt;tilte&gt;</code>
     or <code style="color:red;">&lt;break&gt;</code>.

<li> a start tag is used in place of an end tag: 

<blockquote style="color:red;">
<p>&lt;em&gt;important&lt;em&gt;
</blockquote>

<li> a tag is malformed: 

<blockquote style="color:red;">
<p>&lt;em important&lt;/em&gt;
</blockquote>


<li> an element has an end tag that doesn't match the start tag:

<blockquote style="color:red;">
<p>&lt;h1&gt;CS110 HTML Coding&lt;/h2&gt;
</blockquote>

<li> tags aren't nested properly (really just a special case of the previous bug): 

<blockquote style="color:red;">
<p>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;em&gt;CS110 HTML Coding&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;em&gt;
</blockquote>

<li> attribute names are misspelled/wrong: 

<blockquote style="color:red;">
<p>&lt;img source="logo.jpg" hieght=100&gt;
</blockquote>

<li> quote marks aren't properly matched: 

<blockquote style="color:red;">
<p>&lt;img src="logo.jpg height=100&gt;
</blockquote>

</ul>


<h4>Exercise 5</h4>

<p>Copy the following buggy HTML code into a JSfiddle
and debug the code until it looks like you think it's intended to look. 

<pre>
&lt;h1&gt;A Buggy HTML File&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt; This HTML file contains several &lt;em&gt;bugs&lt;/em&gt; (i.e., errors).
&lt;br&gt;
Can you &lt;em&gt;debug&lt;/em&gt; them (i.e., find and fix them)?

&lt;p&gt;Here's an unordered list with three items: 

&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;strong&lt;/strong&gt; item.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;An ordered sublist with two items: 

        &lt;ol&gt; 

          &lt;p&gt; A CAPITALIZED item 

          &lt;li&gt; An &lt;a href="http://www.wellesley.edu"&gt;
                  &lt;em&gt;italic link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
   
    &lt;li&gt; A final &lt;code&gt;item&lt;code&gt;, using code font.

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's &lt;a href="http://cs.wellesley.edu another link&lt;/a&gt;

</pre><!-- close that extra quotation mark: " -->


<h2 id="validation">Validation of HTML Code</h2>

<p>How can you be sure you've followed every nit-picky rule that the HTML
standards committee devised?  (The standards committee is
the <a href="http://www.w3.org/"><q>World Wide Web Consortium</q></a> or
W3C.)  Even if you have memorized all the rules, checking a page would be
tedious and error-prone &ndash; perfect for a computer!  Fortunately, the
W3C created an <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">HTML validator</a>.  You
can validate by supplying a URL, by uploading a file, or even
copy/pasting in some HTML.  Visit that page and try validating
your <code>little.html</code> file, 
debugged <code>buggy.html</code> file,
or even the file for this lecture. 
An HTML validator is an excellent tool to help you debug your HTML code. 


<p>Validation also helps with accessibility. 
One important aspect of accessibility is having the proper HTML syntax
for each page in your site.  Visitors with accessibility needs will use
the alternative browsers and screen readers, and that software will be
aided by syntactically correct HTML.  Read the following for a longer
discussion
of <a href="http://validator.w3.org/docs/help.html#why-validate">why to
validate your HTML pages</a>.


<p>Throughout the semester, if you need to validate a web page, you can
find the HTML validator and others in the <a
href="../documentation/">validators
section of the CS110 documentation page</a>.

<p>If you haven't already, try validating <code>little.html</code>.
You'll see that it doesn't validate.  The reasons are slightly technical,
so bear with us, but you'll see how to make your own documents valid.

<h3 id="doctype">Document Type</h3>

<p>There are several different, incompatible HTML versions, and so a
  document that is valid HTML 3.2 is invalid HTMl 4.01 and vice versa.
  Neither would be valid XHTML 1.0.  So, the validator needs to know what
  version of HTML you're using.  More importantly, the browser or screen
  reader or other software needs to know what syntax to expect.
  Therefore, the first thing any web page needs to do is announce the
  syntax it's using.  This is done with a special <code>DOCTYPE</code>
  (for <q>document type</q>) tag.  

  <p>In this course, we're using HTML5.  (Your book describes HTML 4.01
  (and also XHTML), but HTML 4.01 is essentially a subset of HTML5, so
  nothing they tell you will be incorrect.)  Fortunately, the doctype for
  HTML5 is very simple and easy, certainly compared to HTML 4.01.  It
  looks like this:

    <pre>
      &lt;!doctype html&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>We urge you just to copy/paste that tag to your own pages and don't
  worry about it further.

    <p><em>Note</em>:  because HTML5 is still pretty new, the validator at W3C
    will give you a warning that the result is "experimental." 

<h3 id="charset">Charset</h3>

<p>A browser needs to know what <em>characters</em> (letters, numbers,
and punctuation) are in the HTML file.  Are they <q>western
European</q> characters, or Russian, Greek, Sanskrit, Korean, Japanese,
Chinese, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/!Kung_people">!Kung</a>
or something else?  This information is called the <em>character set</em>
or <em>charset</em> for short.  For our purposes, we can use something
called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8"><q>UTF-8</q></a>.</p>

<p>To do so, we put a <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag in
the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of our document.  It looks like this:</p>

<pre>
 &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
</pre>

<p>Again, we urge you just to copy/paste that code and don't worry about
it.</p>

<!-- Scott, Jan 2015, omitted this exercise, because it doesn't work well with JSfiddle

<h4>Exercise 6</h4>

<p>Copy the DOCTYPE and CHARSET code into <code>little.html</code>
   and/or the debugged <code>buggy.html</code>
   and check that the result is now valid.

-->

<h3 id="valid_icon">Icon Declaring Validation</h3>

<p>Once you get your page to validate, you can put some HTML code on your
page to give it a <q>seal of approval</q>, declaring that it is valid (and
what standard it meets). You will see in lab examples of this strategy.  
<!--You can see an example on the bottom of the
CS110 pages, including this one.-->

<p>The very cool thing about this icon is that it is clickable, and
clicking it will cause the validator to process your page again.  Thus,
you can modify your page, upload the changes, and click the icon to
re-validate it, making validation <em>very</em> easy.  In fact, we suggest
that you put the icon on your page <em>before</em> it's valid, and use it
during your debugging process.</p>

<p>The snippet of code is just the following, so go ahead and copy/paste
  it into your pages. The code doesn't use anything we don't know, so read
  it!

<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer"&gt;
     &lt;img 
       src="http://cs.wellesley.edu/~cs110/Icons/valid-html5v2.png"
       alt="Valid HTML 5"
       title="Valid HTML 5"  
       height="31" width="88"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

<h2 id="template">An HTML Template</h2>

<p>The preceding requirements result in a kind of <q>boilerplate</q> that
  you'll need for all your web pages. Feel free to copy/paste the
  following to begin all your HTML pages, or to use
  this <a href="HTML-files/template.html">template.html</a>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">

    &lt;meta name=author content="Your name here"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;title here&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

       alt="Valid HTML 5"
       title="Valid HTML 5"  
       height="31" width="88"&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

<div class="new">
<h2 id="div_intro">DIV and CSS</h2>

<p>This section introduces the DIV tag. The DIV tag is a <q>generic</q>
  container tag, which doesn't make a lot of sense yet, but will in the
  next few readings. To motivate the DIV tag, we'll talk a little about
  CSS, but not in a complete or definitive way, so bear with us on
  that. We'll get to CSS very soon.

<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the style language for web pages. Here
  is one way (not even the best way) to put a green box around a
  paragraph:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
  &lt;p style="border: 3px solid green"&gt;Success makes so many people hate you... &amp;mdash;
  Marilyn Monroe&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

<p>Here it is in action:

<blockquote>
  <p style="border: 3px solid green">Success makes so many people hate you... &mdash;
  Marilyn Monroe</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So far, so good. If we wanted to put a box around <em>two</em>
  paragraphs, we would need an element that contains both those
  paragraphs. It turns out that HTML paragraphs can't contain other HTML
  paragraphs, which makes sense because normal everyday paragraphs don't
  contain other paragraphs. 

<p>None of the other HTML elements really work either, so to handle this
situation, the World Wide Web HTML standards committee created
the <code>&lt;DIV&gt;</code> tag, standing for a <q>division</q> of your
document. A DIV can contain anything (paragraphs, lists, headers, and even
other DIVs). Consequently, DIV is very useful and is used a lot. A more
real-world example is a putting a set of links into a DIV and positioning
that to be a navigation area, or putting a set of paragraphs in a DIV to
create a set of posts.  We will use it a lot in CS 110, though we will
also use some newer tags that are intended to reduce the over-use of DIV.

</div>

<h2 id="need-for-meaningful-tags">The need for meaningful tags</h2>

<p>As we've said, HTML was designed to structure the content of a web
  page.  That explains the existence of tags like <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>,
  <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code>, etc. However, when web
  developers started creating pages with a lot of content, it became clear
  that to make better use of the available screen space, a way to organize
  the page content in bigger chunks was needed. Then, CSS could be used to
  arrange their position on the page. Therefore, the
  tag <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> was born (short for <em>division</em>),
  which is currently the most used (and overused) tag in every
  webpage. While this seemed to have solved the page layout problem, HTML
  code became difficult to understand, other computer programs
  (e.g. search engines) couldn't make sense of all divs in a page, if they
  wanted to use the organization of the page for inferring the meaning of
  the content.</p>
          
<p>HTML5 introduced a series of new tags that have meaningful names and
  can be used universally to express what the content is about, beyond the
  existing simple tags. Additionally, to make the pages more alive with
  different kinds of content, several new tags that allow content to be
  embedded in a page were also added.  In the following, we will give a
  short summary of some of these tags. Try to make use of them in your
  pages. They will make your code better and more readable to the programs
  of the future.</p>
            
<h2 id="semantic">Semantic Tags</h2>

<p>Here is a list of new HTML5 tags that are known as semantic tags,

<h4>Browser Support</h4>

<p>Changing the web language standards goes

           <h3 id="figure">The &lt;figure&gt; and &lt;figcaption&gt; tags</h3>
          <p>The tags in action:</p>
          <figure class="text-center">
            <img src="http://static1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120724095441/spiritedaway/images/a/a7/Chihiro.png"

          <p>Here is how to use these two tags</p>
          
          <blockquote>
            <pre>
  &lt;figure&gt; 
    &lt;img src="images/imageName.png" alt="image description" &gt;
    &lt;figcaption&gt;A caption for the image&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
          </pre>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>For more examples and explanation for this pair of tags read this 
            <a href="http://html5doctor.com/the-figure-figcaption-elements/" target="_blank">
              article by the HTML5Doctor website.</a></p>
          
          
          
          
          
          <h3 id="video">The &lt;video&gt; tag</h3>
          <p>Here is an example of embedding video directly on your page:</p>
          
          <div class="text-center">
            <video controls
                 src="http://clips.vorwaerts-gmbh.de/big_buck_bunny.mp4"
                 width="300"
                 id="bunny_video"></video>
          </div>
          
          <blockquote>
            <pre>
  &lt;video controls
            src="http://clips.vorwaerts-gmbh.de/big_buck_bunny.mp4"
            width="300"
            id="bunny_video"
  &gt;
          </pre>
          </blockquote>
          
         <p>The attributes <code>controls</code> and <code>autoplay</code>
           are called boolean attributes.  A tag either has them or
           doesn't have them. Here, we've omitted autoplay, so that the
           page won't make noise when you load it.</p>
          
          <h3 id="audio">The &lt;audio&gt; tag</h3>
          
          <p>Here is an example of embedding audio directly on your page:</p>
          
          <div class="text-center">
          <audio controls>
                <source src="http://www.jingle.org/britsungmont.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
                Your browser does not support the audio element.
          </audio>
          </div>
          
           <blockquote>
  <pre>
    &lt;audio controls&gt;
      &lt;source src="http://www.jingle.org/britsungmont.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"&gt;
      Your browser does not support the audio element.
    &lt;/audio&gt;
  </pre>
          </blockquote>

<h2 id="testing">Live Testing</h2>

<p>Often you want simply to try out new elements or their combination,
 without having to write a complete HTML document. We have already seen
 how the documentation for the HTML tags by
 the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools website</a> provides an
 editing space where to experiment with tags. However, there are many more
 tools on the web that allow you to do the same, for all three languages
 at once: HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
          
<p>One tool that we will be using during lecture time for experimentation is 
  <a href="http://jsfiddle.net">jsfiddle</a>.
  Here is a screenshot from trying out the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>
  tag directly in its workspace.
