      <h2 id="sweb">The Social Web</h2>
        <p><a href="        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_web">The Social Web</a> 
          is an umbrella term referring to the more social experience that started to
        emerge on the Web in the early 2000's. Before that, the Web was static and isolated, in the sense
        that the only connections were links to other web pages, but one couldn't comment or
        like someone's page, collaboratively work on a page, include content from other 
        pages with widgets, or easily share content from other websites. These features 
        were introduced one by one through the 2000's, and named as 
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0 technology</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Nowadays, we take the Facebook Like button, the inclusion of YouTube videos or Google Maps in 
        different pages as granted, but these all occured in the last few years. The 
        improvement and acceptance of Javascript is
        the what enabled this change, and all major web companies (Google, Facebook,
          Twitter, Amazon, ets.) offer APIs that web developers
        can use to incorporate those companies' data and web services into their own websites.</p>
        
        <p>We can observe different ways of incorporating the social web components into 
          usual websites.
          <ul>
          <li>Social icons - these are recognazible icons that suggest a link to the social web
            presence of the website. The image below shows Wellesley's social presence. Every
            icon is a link to the corresponding account on the service.</li>
          <li>Social Widgets - these are pieces of HTML/CSS/Javascript code that one can be easily
            embedded onto a web page and usually display content from a certain website. Examples
            are the Twitter feed, Facebook comments and the like/share buttons, YouTube videos, 
            Google Forms, etc.
            </li>
          <li>Web Services - web services allow a developer to not only display content from another
            web provider, but also to tailor that content and interaction with it to the needs of their
            website users. This requires different levels of Javascript programming, depending on the
            complexities of what needs to be achieved. For example, simply showing a Google Map centered
            on an adress is very simple, however, allowing a user to calculate the route and see location
            icons and more needs the use of Google Maps API methods. </li>
        </ul>

        </figure>
        
        <h2 id="social">Social Icons for Social Presence</h2>
        <p>The easiest way to connect to the Social Web and signalize one's participation in it
        is through social icons. These are links that will take one directly to the social presence
        on a certain website, to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube, etc.</p>
        
        <p>Incorporating such icons is extremely easy. Usually one finds the images of the icons on
        the web and wraps links around them. Below is the example of the HTML snippet from Wellesley's 
        website:</p>
        
        <pre>

&lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/wellesley"&gt;&lt;img alt="Wellesley College Twitter" src="/sites/default/files/assets/global-content/images/twitterbutton.gif" 
style="padding-top:2px; padding-right:5px; padding-left:5px; padding-bottom:2px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

</pre>
        
        <p>Using images as icons is not the only way to create a social icons bar. Icons
        can be fonts too. You have already seen such examples in HW7 and HW8 (the shopping cart
        and the home icon). They were inserted in the page through CSS and are part of the 
        FontAwesome series of web icons. </p>
        
        <p>This <a href="socialicons.html">example page contains a social icons bar</a> 
        created with FontAwesome fonts. 
        The reason for using such fonts is that they allow one to color the icons in the same
        color palette as the website, to avoid distraction from the colorful images of each
        image icon. However, since the icons are fonts, one can change their appearance at will
          with CSS. Click on the button on the page to see the effect.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Using FontAwesome Icons</h4>
        <p>Here is a list of steps to include icons like this in your page:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Link to the CSS stylesheet of FontAwesome, in the same way you do for Google Fonts.</li>
          <pre>
&lt;link href="http://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.2.0/css/font-awesome.min.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
</pre>

          <li>Search the <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/" target="_blank">list of fonts</a> 
            for the icon you want to include, in order to find its Hexadecimal code.</li>
          <li>Add for each icon a line of HTML that might look like the following (this is for Twitter):
 <pre>
&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/wellesley"&gt;&lt;span class="fa fa-twitter"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</pre> 
            Notice that we have supplied two class names for the class attribute.
          </li>
          <li>In your CSS file, add styling for each class. Having a generic class like <q>fa</q>
          for all your icons, allows you to make them look the same way. The specific class is then
          used to insert the content of the icon in the HTML, through this CSS rule:
<pre>
.fa-twitter:before{
    content:  "\f081"; /* icon for twitter-square */
}
</pre>          
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This is all you need to do. The <code>:before</code> pseudo-element, is a CSS3
        pseudo-selector that manipulates the content of an HTML element in the page, similar
        to <code>:first-letter</code> that we have seen in the past. Read more about 
        <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_before.asp" target="_blank">:before</a> in W3Schools.</p>

        <h2 id="widgets">Social Widgets</h2>
        
        <p>The social icons will redirect a user from the current website to another one
        and often you might not desire this. What is better is to bring your content (or 
        that of someone else) into your own pages through social widgets. </p>
        <p>For example, the Facebook Like button allows both to perform the action of liking
        a page, but also that of conveying the information of how many other people have done
        so and potentially the identities of these people if they are in your circle of friends.</p>
        
        <p>Incorporating social widgets in a website cannot be done without visiting the websites
        and help pages of the web applications that offer such widgets. Some of them make it very
        easy to do this. Here are some examples:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Adding a YouTube video - Visit the page of the video, click on the link
          Share, then the link Embed and copy the provided HTML code into your page. For example:
<pre>
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/8zLx_JtcQVI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>&lt;/iframe&gt;
</pre> 
          <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> is an HTML tag that allows to embed content from other pages onto a page.
            It can take several attributes that will customize the experience. For example,
            to have the video start on its own, you add <code>autoplay=1</code>. The documentation
            for such widgets, usually provides the list of all possible attributes that can be added
            to the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> tag.
          </li>
          
          <li>Adding a Google Calendar - Open the Calendar, click on upper-right icon 
            <img src="settings.png" width="40"> and choose Settings. This opens a new page titled 
            <q>Calendar Settings</q>. Choose the tab <q>Calendars</q>, and click on the link
            of the calendar you want to share on the web. This opens a new page with the details
            of this calendar. Scroll down to find the field <q>Embed This Calendar</q>. There
            you'll find the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> tag again with the HTML code you need. See an example of
            how this looks like on <a href="http://cs.wellesley.edu/~anderson/" target="_blank">Prof. Anderson's web page</a>.
          </li>
          
          <li>Adding a Google From - Create a Google Form through your Google Docs account. Then
          click on File | Embed and copy the HTML code snippet.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Adding Google Forms is easy, but they will look like Google Forms on your page and you
        might not like that. We have created an example to show you how one can customize Google Forms
        using HTML/CSS/Javascript. The original and modified Google Form is shown 
          <a href="googleforms.html" target="_blank">in this example
        page.</a> We have written a <a href="googleforminstructions.pdf" target="_blank">short document to explain</a> 
          this process, feel free to contact
        us if you are having trouble following the instructions.</p>
        
        <p>Another kind of social widgets, such as Facebook Like or Facebook Comments, or Twitter
        timeline, require a bit more effort. In fact, one would need to interact with these websites,
        in order to get the needed code to embed in the HTML page. Very often both HTML and Javascript
        code are needed.</p>
        
        <p>Here is the Javascript code from our <a href="plugins.html" target="_blank">plugins examples page</a> to 
          embed Facebook Like and Comments.</p>
        
        <pre>
 &lt;div id="fb-root"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;(function(d, s, id) {
      var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];
      if (d.getElementById(id)) return;
      js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;
      js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=&amp;<strong>appId=275908045906968</strong>";
      fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);
    }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));&lt;/script&gt;

</pre>
        
    <div class="alert alert-warning">
    <p>Notice that this piece of code contains an <strong>appId</strong> attribute that belongs
      to a Facebook app that Eni has created. If you want to see who has liked your page or
      other statistics from Facebook about social interactions with your page, you will need
      to go to <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/">Facebook Developer</a>, create your
      own app connected to your Website and then use its app ID. Eni has written 
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/wellesley.edu/document/d/1BO3-jl-HUhXwWgtV7irOubhP5QHXEpCyRR4vHwiuNe4/edit" target="_blank">some notes that show how to create a Facebook app</a>. You only need to read the first two pages.</p>    
    </div>
  
    <p>In addition to the Javascript code, you also need some HTML code. This code is 
        also generated by Facebook, and you'll need to visit the Developers page to get it.
        Here are 
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/wellesley.edu/document/d/1NrIkxDrJeusAiKbSsTteeFxRCVs8qiTlCKRZarOKDKg/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">some notes</a> that would help you with this task.</p>
        
  <p>For exmaple, the code for the Facebook Like button will look like this:</p> 
        <pre>
&lt;iframe src="//www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=http%3A%2F%2F<strong>cs.wellesley.edu%2F%7Ecs110%2F</strong>&amp;width&amp;layout=standard&amp;action=like&amp;show_faces=true&amp;share=false&amp;height=80&amp;<strong>appId=275908045906968</strong>" 
       scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none; overflow:hidden; height:80px;" 
       allowTransparency="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

</pre>        
       <p>Notice how the words on bold are specific to our application (liking the CS110 website).
        By creating this code through the Facebook page, you'll make sure to use your own
        website information and Facebook app ID.</p> 
        
        <p>Adding a Twitter timeline is very similar, you'll need to have a Twitter account that 
        will allow you to create a widget for a timeline you're interested in. This is the example
        from our <a href="plugins.html" target="_blank">plugins page.</a></p>
        
        <pre>
&lt;script&gt;!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],
p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);
js.id=id;js.src=p+"://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js";
fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,"script","twitter-wjs");&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;a class="twitter-timeline" data-dnt="true" href="https://twitter.com/Wellesley" 
 <strong>data-widget-id="450818279653658624"</strong>&gt;Tweets by @Wellesley&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

</pre>
        
        <h2 id="apis">Web APIs</h2>
        
        <p>Another way of incorporating content on your pages is through web APIs. The most common use
        of that is for inserting Google Maps on a page.</p>
        
        <p>Here is an example of showing <a href="http://cs.wellesley.edu/~mashups/wellesley/" target="_blank">the map of Wellesley College</a>, together with some more 
        sophisticated stuff (like location icons and click events for these icons).</p>
        <p>The steps for including a Google Maps on your page are the following:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>In your HTML file, you import the Javascript library for Google Maps and create an empty
          div where the map will show up.</li>
          <pre>    
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=false"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;div id="map"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
          <li>In your CSS file, you add the following rule for the div. <strong>Failure to add this rule will
            result in the map not showing up in the page.</strong></li>
          <pre>
#map {
  width: 100%; /* use number or % depending on how big you want the map */
  height: 94%;
}
</pre>
          <li>In your Javascript file, add the following code:
  <pre>
var map; // global variable

// when page is loaded execute this function
window.onload = function() {
  
    // Specify the options for the map
    var options = {  
      zoom: 17,
      center: new google.maps.LatLng(42.292581,-71.305517),  
      mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.HYBRID  
    };  
    
    // make the map show up in our div with id "map"
    map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById("map"), options);	
</pre>    
                  
          </li>
 
        </ul>
        
  <p>Here is an example of how a student in Spring 2014 used Google Maps together with
        the weather forecast. </p>
      <figure class="text-center">
        
          <img src="mapweather.png" alt="google weather map" class="img-thumbnail" width=400>
          <figcaption>Using Google Maps and weather for the project (student from Spring 2014).</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>For a more sophisticated use of maps (allowing users to enter locations by name),
        I've written a <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/wellesley.edu/document/d/1V4AxzCch-eKr1M4_Q3787zbt6jGwr-x-gIn4KnCu_sQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">tutorial for the CS249 Web Mashups course</a>.</p>
