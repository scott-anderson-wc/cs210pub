# Grid Systems, Skeleton and Bootstrap

When we have a display device larger than a phone, we often want to switch
to a different layout, with different columns and such. For example, we
might have a nav bar on the left and a twitter feed to the right in
addition to a wide column of main content in the center. We might even
have multiple columns of content.  To make things neat and orderly, we
often have a layout based on a *grid*.  (Typically, you'll see the grid
based on 960px, not because that amount matches any device size, but
because 960 is divisible in lots of ways.)

For an idea of the theory, please read the Mozilla Developer Network
article on
[grids](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids)
Fair warning, though, it is long. 

In this class, I'm using [Skeleton](https://getskeleton.com) which I like
a lot because it's simple and well-documented. However, I acknowledge that
many people like Bootstrap, and you're welcome to use that, too. The MDN
article mentions both Skeleton and Bootstrap.
