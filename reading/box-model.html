-->

         <p>Page layout involves placing page elements (such as text and graphics)
where you choose on a page.  In the past, page layout was done with
special HTML tags, including tables. The modern approach is to separate
the page layout from the page contents by using CSS.  This has the
advantage that you can have different layouts for different media
(screens, printouts, cellphones) as well as keeping the HTML clean and
uncluttered for those users who don't use the CSS, such as a blind person
who uses screen reading software.</p>
  
          <h2 id="boxes">Boxes</h2>
          
          <p>To understand page layout, you first have to understand that, to a web
  browser, a web page is a series
  of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html" title="the box
  model">boxes</a>.  The boxes have a width and height, and they get
  assembled (laid out) on the page, much the way Ben Franklin might have
  laid out the text and pictures in his newpaper.

</p><p>Boxes come in two kinds: <em>blocks</em> and <em>inline</em>.

</p><p>A <em>block</em> is something big like a paragraph or
a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.  Blocks are preceded and followed by line
breaks, so Ben Franklin or the layout engine stacks them vertically on the
page.  (Normally, a block doesn't have anything to the left or right,
though we will see some exceptions later.)</p>

<p>An <em>inline</em> element (box) is something like a word, where Ben
Franklin or the layout engine fills up a line with as many as it can, then
goes on to the next line, and so forth.  You may be surprised to learn
that <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> elements are inline, so that a line is
filled with as many images as will fit before starting the next line.
(That's why centering an image is tricky; we'll look at that a bit later.)
</p>

<h2>DIV and SPAN</h2>

<p>The <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element is the generic <em>block</em> element. A
  DIV can contain any other element, including other DIVs. You can nest
  DIVs as deep as you want. It has no semantics, but we can style it by
  using CSS (often adding an ID or a class to the element, to distinguish
  it from other DIVs).  Because DIV is a generic container, we will often
  use it to structure our pages. It will feature in many of the examples below.

<p>The <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element is the generic <em>inline</em>
  element. As with DIV, span has no semantics, but we can style it using
  CSS, and, of course, we can add ID and class if we want.

<p>A span can contain other inline elements, including other spans, but no
  inline element can contain a block element.  That means you can put EM
  inside a P, but not vice versa. The browser may let you get away with
  it, but the validator won't.

<h2 id="mbp">Margins, Borders and Padding</h2>

<p>The contents of a box can optionally be surrounded by a
  border.  For example, the following CSS

</p><pre><code class="css">p {
    border: 2px dashed red;
}
</code></pre>

<p>will put a 2 pixel dashed red line around the contents of each
paragraph.

</p><p><em>Padding</em> is the distance between the contents of the box and
  the border.  By default, it's zero, but if you'd like a little more room
  between your text and the border, you can increase it.  Even if you
  don't have a border, padding can be used to increase the distance
  between the contents of your box and the contents of any neighboring
  boxes.

  </p><p><em>Margins</em> are the distance between the borders and the
  next element.  However, it's not quite as simple as that, because 
  the margins for vertical elements
  sometimes <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html#collapsing-margins">collapse</a>.
  Margin collapse means that if a box A has a bottom margin of X and is
  followed by box B with a top margin of Y, the two
  are <code>max(X,Y)</code> apart, not <code>X+Y</code>.  That sounds
  weird, but it's usually what you want. If you specify that both have a
  margin of <code>Z</code>, they will be <code>Z</code> apart rather
  than <code>2*Z</code>.

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>Here's an example that does uses all these measures:
<div class="eg_box">
  <p>Now is the winter of our discontent, turned glorious summer by this
  sun of York.
  <p>Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country.
</div>

<p>Here's the CSS. Notice we use a descendant selector, so as not to
  modify every paragraph on the page.

<pre class="prettyprint lang-css"><code class="css">
.eg_box p {
   border: 1px solid orange;
   background-color: yellow;
   padding: 5px 2em;
   margin: 10px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Again, we've used short-hand properties. With padding and margins, if
  you give one number, as we did with the margin, you get 10px on all four
  sides. If you give two numbers, as we did with the padding, the first
  one is the top and bottom, and the second is the left and right. If you
  give <em>four</em> numbers, you can specify all four sides, in the order
  top, right, bottom and left (clockwise from the top). So the following
  is equivalent:
  
<pre class="prettyprint lang-css"><code class="css">
.eg_box p {
   border: 1px solid orange;
   background-color: yellow;
   padding: 5px 2em 5px 2em;
   margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that margin-collapse means that the two paragraphs are 10px apart,
  which is reasonable and easy to specify.  So margin-collapse is usually
  a help rather than a hindrance.

<p>You are probably wondering how to set all these distances.  There
are CSS properties to control the thickness of each side of the box
(margin, border, and padding) as well as the style of the border if
there is a border.  There are also shorthand forms that let you define
things more compactly.  Consult a
good <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_reference.asp"
title="CSS properties">reference on CSS properties</a>

<h2 id="units">Lengths and Units</h2>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Now that you've seen some CSS properties
whose values are <em>lengths</em>, you'll want to know what values they
can have.  For example, we indented this paragraph by half an inch.  It's
the only indented paragraph in the site.  We did it using the following
code:
</p>
          
<pre<code class="html">>&lt;p style="text-indent: 0.5in"&gt;Now that you've seen some CSS properties ...
</code></pre>

<p>You might guess that <code>in</code> means <q>inches.</q> To
specify lengths effectively, you need to know the <em>units</em> that
CSS uses.  They come in several categories:

</p><ul>

<li><em>Ruler measures.</em> Inches (<code>in</code>), centimeters
(<code>cm</code>), and millimeters (<code>mm</code>).

</li><li><em>Pixels.</em> These measures are in pixels, so they're less
flexible if the web page will be printed out onto paper, but they're
useful on the web.  This unit is specified using <code>px</code>.

</li><li><em>Printer units.</em> You probably know that font sizes are
measured in <em>points,</em> as in a <q>12 point font.</q>
One <em>point</em> is equal to 1/72 of an inch, and is specified by using
<code>pt</code>.  

</li><li><em>Font-relative units.</em> These measures are proportional to
the size of the font, so they are bigger if the font is bigger, 
and smaller if it's smaller.  This is great because visually impaired people
may increase the font size to much greater than you'd ever expect, and
you'd like the web page lengths to scale appropriately.  These are
appropriate measures for, say, the distance between lines (called the
<em>leading,</em> from strips of lead that were put between the rows of
type back in the olden days of actual lead type).  The two font-relative
sizes are <code>em</code> and <code>ex</code>.  The <code>em</code>
measure is named for the width of the letter <q>M</q> in the current font,
and in CSS is defined to be equal to the size of the font.  The
<code>ex</code> measure is named for the height of the letter <q>x</q> in
the current font, and in CSS is usually about half the size of the font.

</li><li><em>Alternative Font-relative units.</em> The <code>EM</code> is
        a good unit, but because it's inherited, and can be changed by
        different ancestor elements, it can be constantly changing based
        on its context.  Enter <q>Root EM</q> or <code>REM</code>
        unit. It's always equal to the font-size specified on
        the <code>HTML</code> element, which typically defaults to 16px on
        most browsers. Thus, you can use 1rem as an equivalent to 16px,
        but with the benefit that if the you or the user has changed the
        default font size, your REM units will scale appropriately. Here
        is a discussion of <a href="http://zellsk.com/blog/rem-vs-em/">REM
        versus EM</a>, which suggests a set of simple rules and shows how
        they play out.
        <ol>
            <li>Size in <code>em</code> if the property scales according
            to its <code>font-size</code>
                
            <li>Size everything else in <code>rem</code>.
        </ol>

</li><li><em>Percentages.</em> These are best for elements whose size you 
want to specify relative to the size of the enclosing element or the window.  

<p>If you want a paragraph to be three-fourths the width of
the enclosing <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, you can use code like the
following:

<pre><code class="css">
#content {
   width: 800px;
   margin-left: 100px;
}

#note {
   width: 75%;
   margin-left: 25%;
}

&lt;div id="content"&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Here's the usual contents of the page ...&lt;/p&gt;
   ...
   &lt;p id="note"&gt;And here is a narrow note on the right side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Look at the <a href="box-model-files/percentage.html" title="an example of setting paragraph widths using percentages">percentage example in action</a>.

</ul>

<h2 id="inline_images">Images are Inline Elements</h2>

<p>Pictures (image elements, produced by the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag)
  are <em>inline</em> elements.  This may seem odd, since images look so
  much like big box-like things, and therefore ought to be <em>block</em>
  elements, but they are (by default), inline elements.  So, the browser
  treats them like big words.  Here's an example:

<div class="eg_box">
  <p>Bonnie and Chester were enjoying a picnic on the
  <img src="box-model-files/icons/grass.png" alt="grass">.  Suddenly the sky filled with dark
  <img src="box-model-files/icons/ic_menu_cloud.png" alt="clouds">.  Soon, it began to
  <img src="box-model-files/icons/weather-rain.png" alt="rain">.  When the
  <img src="box-model-files/icons/Lightning.png" alt="lightning"> began, they decided to
  head for
  <img src="box-model-files/icons/home.png" alt="home">.
</div>


<h2 id="centering">Centering Content</h2>

<p>Before we get to more complex stuff, let's look at centering content,
particularly images, since that's a common desire among CS110 students.
  Let's start, though, with centering lines of text within a block.
  Here's an eye chart:

<div class="verbatim example">
<div class="eg_box" style="text-align: center">
  <span style="font-size: 60px">E</span><br>
  <span style="font-size: 40px">F P</span><br>
  <span style="font-size: 30px">T O Z</span><br>
  <span style="font-size: 20px">L P E D</span><br>
  <span style="font-size: 15px">P E C F D</span><br>
  <span style="font-size: 12px">E F D C Z P</span><br>
  <span style="font-size: 10px">F E L O P Z D</span><br>
</div>
</div>

<p>All we had to do was to use the CSS property <code>text-align:
    center</code>.  (Note that we used an inline style sheet in the
    example code, just for brevity.  In practice, we would probably add a
    class to this div and define it in an external style sheet).

<p>Since images are just like big letters, the same trick will work with
  images:
  
<div class="verbatim example">
<div class="eg_box" style="text-align: center">
  <img src="box-model-files/icons/grass.png" alt="grass"><br>
  <img src="box-model-files/icons/ic_menu_cloud.png" alt="clouds">
  <img src="box-model-files/icons/weather-rain.png" alt="rain">
  <img src="box-model-files/icons/Lightning.png" alt="lightning"><br>
  <img src="box-model-files/icons/home.png" alt="home">
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="center_text">Centering Text</h2>

<p>You should almost never center lines of text in a paragraph (unless
you're making lots of eye charts).  You get ragged edges left and right,
which looks ugly.  Also, depending on the font, amount of text and the
width of the region, the last line may be weirdly short (and centered).
Here's a <a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/27745.html">Tolkien
quote</a>:

<div class="eg_box tolkien_quote" style="text-align: center;">
  Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle and quick
  to anger.
</div>

<p>You probably don't want that single word centered on the second
  line.  But that can happen (and all-too-often does) when you center text
  and don't have complete control over browser-width, font-size, and the
  like.

<p>Instead, what you probably want is to have normal, left-aligned text in
  a box that is itself centered.  Let's see how to center boxes.

<h2 id="center_block">Centering a Block</h2>

<p>To center a block, you have to give it a width that is smaller than
  its parent (which might be the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>), and setting its
left and right margins to be <code>auto</code>.  <q>Auto</q> means to take
the leftover space on the line and distribute it equally among the
<q>auto</q> elements.  If both margins are <code>auto</code>, the element
is centered.  Thus:

<div id="outer_box_example">
<p id="inner_box_example">
  Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle and quick
  to anger.
</p>
</div>

<p>Here's the code that accomplishes that:
<pre class="prettyprint lang-css"><code class="css">
#outer_box_example {  width: 80%; border: 3px solid blue; }
#inner_box_example {  width: 70%; border: 2px solid red; margin: 0 auto; }
</code></pre>  

<p>This makes the browser calculate the necessary margin for centering,
  and works even when the widths are in percentages. When the width is a
  percentage, it is calculated as a percent of its <em>parent</em>, not
  the whole window.  So in this case, the inner box is 70 percent of the
  outer box, and the outer box is 80 percent of the area where this
  paragraph is. You'll notice that the outer one is not centered, though. 

<h2 id="center_image">Centering Images</h2>

<p>An alternative technique for centering images is to use the same margin
  trick that works for centering other block elements, such as the
  paragraph above.  The difference is that <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is
  already a block element, while
<code>&lt;img&gt;</code> is inline.  However, we can change an
<code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element to be a block by using the
<code>display: block</code> style.  That is, to make an image that
is centered, use a style sheet that makes the image <a
href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/css/classification/display.html"><code>display</code></a>
as a <code>block</code>, and sets the <a
href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/css/box/margin-left.html"><code>margin-left</code></a>
and <a
href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/css/box/margin-right.html"><code>margin-right</code></a>
to <code>auto</code>.

<div class="verbatim example">
<p>
  <img src="box-model-files/buffypics/buffy.gif" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Buffy Summers">
  <img src="box-model-files/buffypics/angel.gif" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Angel">
</div>

<p>Note that by making the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> be <code>block</code>,
they stack vertically, even without the <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tags.  If
we had tried to use the <code>text-align: center</code> technique, the two
pictures would have appeared next to each other on the line. (Of course,
that may be what you <em>want</em>, in certain circumstances.)

<p>You should consult this web reference on <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/center.html">Centering
Things in CSS</a>.</p>

<h2 id="width">Box Widths</h2>

<p>Consider the following example of <a href="box-model-files/overfull-box.html">an
overfull box</a>.  Look at the CSS for it.  Why does the browser have a
horizontal scroll bar?  The box is 100% of the container, not 110%.</p>

<p>The solution to this mystery is that the width of a box is defined to
be the width of its <em>contents</em>, not the width of the box.  (If you
think this is a stupid definition, you would find many who agree with you,
but we're stuck with this definition.)  Thus, if you define a box to be
100%, it had better not have any margin, border, or padding, or it will
be <q>overfull</q>.</p>

<p>One way to avoid the creation of overfull boxes is to nest two boxes, 
set the width of the outer one, and
then use the inner one to set the margins, border and padding.  By
default, the dimensions of the inner box will be determined by the outer
one, which is just what you want.  Here is an example of
a <a href="box-model-files/full-box.html">full, not overfull box</a> created with this idea.
          
<!-- This material is taken from a new lecture written from scratch on Feb
2014.-->

<h2 id="background_images">Background Images</h2>

<p id="bgimage">You have already seen the
 property <code>background-image</code> in a few examples. The
 background-image property will cover the screen area corresponding to
 that element. If the image is smaller than the element, the image will be
 repeated horizontally and vertically (like tiles on a floor), unless you
 say it shouldn't be repeated.  This paragraph is put on a wooden
 background image by using the following CSS:

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-css"><code class="css">
#bgimage {
    background: url("wood-texture.jpeg");
}
</code></pre>

<p>The header for this section also uses a background image. We make the
  image not-repeat and slide the text over by using some padding (not
  margin), like this:
  
  <pre class="prettyprint lang-css"><code class="css">
#background_images {
    background: url("cs110.png") no-repeat;
    padding-left: 35px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can learn more and try it out at this
  page: <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-image.asp">W3
  Schools background image</a>.

<h2 id="rounded_corners">Rounded Corners</h2>  

<p>CSS3 introduces a way to round the corners of your elements using CSS
  alone.  Each corner is treated as a quarter ellipse, which is defined by
  a curve that is drawn between a point on the x-axis and a point on the
  y-axis, as shown in the left graph below. A quarter ellipse can be
  regular, which means the length along both axes is the same, or
  irregular, which means the length along each axis is different (see
  graph on the right).
          
          <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-6">
                <figure class="text-center">
                  <img src="box-model-files/quarter.png" alt="quarter ellipse"
                 class="img-thumbnail">
                  <figcaption>A quarter ellipse made by the curve between lengths on the x and y axes.</figcaption>
                  </figure>
              </div>
            
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <figure class="text-center">
                  <img src="box-model-files/rounded.png" alt="example of rounded corners"
                 class="img-thumbnail">
                  <figcaption>A regular curve (left) has identical values on both axes; 
                    an irregular curve has different values on each axis.
                  </figcaption>
                  </figure>
              </div>
           </div>

<p>CSS3 introduced the <code>border-radius</code> property to implement
  the rounded corners. Similar to the <code>border</code> property that
  can be specified by
  <code>-top</code>, <code>-right</code>, <code>-bottom</code>, and <code>-left</code>,
  we can specifiy the x and y values for each corner separately. Below is a concrete
  example:</p>
            
<pre class="prettyprint lang-css"><code class="css">
div {
    border-top-left-radius: 20px; 
    border-top-right-radius: 20px; 
    border-bottom-right-radius: 20px; 
    border-bottom-left-radius: 20px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>If only one value has been specified, that means that both x and y are
  using the same radius. Otherwise, we will specify two values in every
  line.  Clearly, if the radius is the same for all corners, we can simply
  write the rule as: <code>{border-radius: 20px; }</code>. Additionally,
  we can use the shorthand syntax to specify different values for x and y
  using this syntax: <code>border-radius: { horizontal-radius /
  vertical-radius; }</code>, where each side of the slash can contain
  between one and four values, as with the shorthand for regular curves.
</p>
            
<p>We have grouped different uses of this rule in one single page of 
  <a href="box-model-files/css3_examples/ex4.html">rounded corner
    examples</a>. Use the "View Source" on the browser (or Inspect Element) to
  look at the syntax for every rule and what it achieves on the page.</p>


<h2 class="line">Even more CSS</h2>

<p>You can stop here; the following material is optional. There are some
  fun, eye-candy effects that you can do with CSS3, but none of it is
  necessary for a functional, nice-looking website.
  
<h2>Multiple Background Images</h2>

<p>Here is the <a href="box-model-files/css3_examples/ex1.html">example of a page with one 
    background image</a>, which was generated with this CSS rule:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-css"><code class="css">
header {
  height: 640px;
  background: url('images/blue-sky.jpg') no-repeat;
}
</code></pre>
          
<p> To make things more interesting we can add other images on top of an
existing background image, again, only using CSS3.

<p>Here is a new page created by <a href="box-model-files/css3_examples/ex2.html">adding
    the bird on the blue sky</a> from the previous example.</p>
            
          <p>This is the CSS rule we used:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-css"><code class="css">
header {
  height: 640px;
  background: url('images/bird.png') no-repeat,
              url('images/blue-sky.jpg') no-repeat; 
}
</code></pre>            

        <p>Notice that we use a <code>,</code> to list all images that we want to appear
            in the background. The order in which the images appear in this list is
            very important. The image that needs to be behind everything else should be
            last in this list as well. 
          
        <p>However, in order for the effect to look nice,
            the foreground images need to have <em>transparent</em> background themselves.
            Here is how our bird image looks like if you open it with a image processing
            tool:</p>
            <figure class="text-center">
              <img src="box-model-files/bird_transparent.png" alt="image of a bird"
                   class="img-thumbnail">
            </figure>
 
        <p>The <code>background</code> property has multipe subproperties that 
          are useful to create more interesting effects. For example, using
          <code>background-position</code> we can place our bird in any 
          location over the blue sky. Here is the <a href="box-model-files/css3_examples/ex2-1.html">
          center bottom example</a>.
          </p>
          <p>We needed to add one line to our CSS rule:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-css"><code class="css">
header {
  height: 640px;
  background: url('images/bird.png') no-repeat, 
              url('images/blue-sky.jpg') no-repeat; 
  <strong>background-position: center bottom, 0% 0%;</strong>
}
</code></pre>
          <p>Because there are two images, we specify the position for both of them. This
          property takes several values and you can play with them in this 
          <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/playit.asp?filename=playcss_background-position">
          interactive example from the W3Schools</a>.
          </p>
          
          <p>Additionally, by using another property, <code>background-size</code>, we
          can compose scenes with multiple images, as shown in this 
            <a href="box-model-files/css3_examples/ex2-2.html">example with many 
          flying birds</a>.</p>
          
<pre class="prettyprint lang-css"><code class="css">
header {
  height: 640px;
  background: url('images/bird.png') no-repeat 5% 105%, 
              url('images/bird.png') no-repeat 20% 60%, 
              url('images/bird.png') no-repeat 40% 80%, 
              url('images/bird.png') no-repeat 60% 40%, 
              url('images/bird.png') no-repeat 70% 45%, 
              url('images/bird.png') no-repeat 60% 50%, 
              url('images/blue-sky.jpg') no-repeat 50% 50%; 
  background-size: auto, 10%, 10%, 5%, 5%, 5%,  auto;
}
</code></pre>
          
          <p>The <code>background-size</code> property can also 
            <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_background-size.asp">
              take values of different kinds</a>. The values in % shown in our
          example, refer to the size of the parent element of the background, in this case
          <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>. Since its size is 960x650 pixels, a 10% image will show as
          96x65 pixels. Finally, notice that in this example, we have added the 
          <code>background-position</code> values to each image (after <code>no-repeat</code>).
            Each of the pairs shows the left and top coordinate for where the image
            is placed.
          </p>
