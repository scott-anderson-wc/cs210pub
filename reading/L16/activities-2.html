  <p>We will initially complete some of the activities from the

  <p>Also, we apologize for the readings for today. It wasn't what we
  intended, and we didn't discover the trouble until too late. We'll
  rewrite them and re-post.
</div>
<hr>
<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>By the end of today, you'll have had some experience with using loops
  to process simple lists of numbers. You'll see how functions and event
  handlers can make for pages with interactive sound playing. We'll also
  have a fun egg-hunting game.

<h2>Reading Recap</h2>

<p>Let's first recap the new concepts and techniques that we saw in the
reading:
  <ul>
    <li><code>document.querySelectorAll()</code> is a companion to
    the <code>document.querySelector()</code> that we are already familiar
    with.
      <ul>
        <li>The differences are that (1) the selector is allowed to match
    more than one element of the document and (2) the function returns
    an <em>array</em> of all the elements that match.
          
        <li>Since we now understand how to loop over an array, we can
        easily do something with every element that matches.  (Think of
        how this might have been useful in the Madlib assignment.)
          
        <li>In the reading, the code loops over all the elements
        matching <code>#words img</code> and adds an event handler to each
        one.
          
      </ul>
    <li>Google hosts a bunch of MP3 files that are the pronunciations of
    different dictionary words
      
    <li>Assigning a <code>src</code> to an <code>audio</code> element
    (that has <code>autoplay</code> set) will cause the MP3 to be loaded
    and played.
      
  </ul>
<p>The example in the reading used these techniques to add click-handlers
  to pronounce the words that were next to the audio elements.


<h2>The Sound Playing Example</h2>

<p>First, let's see that example again, here in a slightly different form.

<a href="../../documentation/js-examples/play_audio.html"
   target="_blank">example that uses a Javascript function to add an
audio element</a> on the fly to a page. 

<!--
<a href="play_audio.html"
   target="_blank">example that uses a Javascript function to add an
audio element</a> on the fly to a page. 
-->


<p>Observations:
<ul>
  <li>The page initially has four paragraphs, each with a word, an icon
  and an audio element, in that order.

  <li>The code at the end of the <code>.js</code> file sets up the page,
  adding an <code>onclick</code> event handler to each icon
    
  <li>The event handler looks to the siblings of the image that was
  clicked on for information (the word to pronounce) and abilities (the
  audio element).
</ul>

<h2>Alternative playSound</h2>

<p>The <code>playSound</code> function is like this:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">  
function playSound() {

  var word = this.previousSibling.innerHTML;
  console.log("word is: "+word);    // here's the interesting stuff
  var audio = this.nextSibling;
  var url = "https://ssl.gstatic.com/dictionary/static/sounds/de/0/" + word + ".mp3";
  audio.setAttribute("src",url);
}
</pre>

<h2>Quiz Question Nr. 1</h2> 
<p>Below is the structure of each paragraph in the page:</p>          
<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img src="icons/play.png" alt="sound icon"&gt;&lt;audio&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
<p>What would happen if we rearranged some of the elements in each paragraph,
  such as putting the audio element before the icon?
  <ol type="A">
    <li>The code would be fine
    <li>The code would break because <code>this</code> would have the
    wrong value
    <li>The code would break because <code>playSound</code> would not get invoked.
    <li>The code would break because the siblings of <code>this</code>
    would be different elements.
  </ol>

<p>Let's consider alternative ways to do a page like this
  
<h2>Quiz Question Nr. 2</h2> 

<p>Is it possible to make the words clickable instead of the icons?
  <ol type="A">
    <li>yes, if we can get the right selector to get a list of the <code>span</code> elements
    <li>yes, if we can get event handler for them
    <li>no, only the image icons can be clickable
    <li>no, because it needs to be next to the audio element.
  </ol>

<h2>Quiz Question Nr. 3</h2> 

<p>Do we need four audio elements?
  <ol type="A">
    <li>yes, we need a different one for each word
    <li>yes, because the audio element needs to be in the same paragraph
    as the word
    <li>no, because we're setting the src to a URL that depends on the word
    <li>no, but we do need more than one audio element.
  </ol>

<h2>Easter Egg Hunt</h2>

<p>For fun, Scott and Eni have built
a very cool <a href="easter-egg-hunt.html">egg hunt game</a>.

<p>Let's look at the materials of the game, starting with
  the <a href="eggs/">game images</a>

<p>Next, a quick look at the important CSS:
<pre class="prettyprint lang-css linenums">
    div {float: left; 
         width: 100px;
         height: 100px;
      border: 1px red solid;
      margin: 2px;
    }
    div img {width: 100px; visibility: hidden;}
    div.shown img { visibility: visible; }
</pre>  

<p>So, any <code>img</code> inside a <code>div</code> is hidden, but we
  can make it visible by adding the <code>shown</code> class to
  the <code>div</code>.

<h2>Egg Hunt Code</h2>

<p>Now it's time to understand the code.

<p>Let's look at some of the functions, in turn.  The first prepares the
  game board by hiding some images in randomly selected cells:
  
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js linenums">
function prepare_game() {
    var cellsCount = create_grid();
    
    // randomly select the number of total images
    var filesCount = fileNames.length;
    var imageLimit = Math.min(filesCount,cellsCount);
    var totalImages = Math.floor(Math.random()*imageLimit);
    document.querySelector("#total").innerHTML = totalImages;
    document.querySelector("#found").innerHTML = foundByUser;
    // randomly select the image indices
    var imageIdxArr = getArrayRandomNumbers(totalImages, filesCount);
    // randomly select the div indices to hold the images
    var divIdxArr = getArrayRandomNumbers(totalImages, cellsCount);
    
    setImages(imageIdxArr, divIdxArr);
}
</pre>  

<p>That code is pretty complicated, so we'll walk through it step by step.

<p>(Note that the <code>create_grid</code> function creates all the cells
  (as many as it can, depending on how big our window is), and tells us
  (by returning a value) how many cells there are.  We won't look at the
  details of that.)

  <ul>
    <li>We find out how many cells we have to hide the eggs in
      
    <li>We find out how many eggs we have (<code>filesCount</code>)
      
    <li>The min of those is the most eggs we could hide
      
    <li>Choose a random number of eggs, up to that max
      
    <li>insert onto the page the total and number found so far\
      
    <li>get a list of random image indexes (eggs)
      
    <li>get a list of random cell indexes (hiding places)
      
    <li>Hide the eggs.
  </ul>

<p>Suppose that <code>totalImages</code> is a number like 3. The last two
  lines pick 3 images out of the set of egg images, and they also pick 3
  cells out of the grid (however many there turn out to be), to put the 3
  images into.


<h2>Quiz Question Nr. 4</h2> 

<p>Which of the following is okay?
  <ol type="A">
    <li>swapping lines 5 and 6
    <li>swapping lines 6 and 7
    <li>swapping lines 7 and 8
    <li>swapping lines 8 and 9
  </ol>

<p>Let's look at how the eggs are hidden:

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-js linenums">
function setImages(imgArr, divArr) {
    console.log("inside setImages");
    if( imgArr.length != divArr.length ) {
        console.log("something has gone wrong: array lengths don't match");
        return;
    }
    for (var i=0; i < imgArr.length; i++) {
        var imgIdx = imgArr[i];
        var divId = divArr[i];
        setOneImage(imgIdx, divId);
    }
}
  </pre>

<p>This is pretty much our standard loop, being applied in a slightly
  different way. All the interesting work is in
  the <code>setOneImage</code> function:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js linenums">
  function setOneImage(imageIndex, divId) {
    console.log("image "+imageIndex+" will go in cell "+divId);
    var div = document.querySelector("#i_"+divId);
    var imgEl = document.createElement("img");
    var filename = fileNames[imageIndex];
    imgEl.setAttribute("src", "eggs/"+filename+".png");
    imgEl.setAttribute("alt", filename);
    div.appendChild(imgEl);
    div.onclick = showImage;
}
</pre>  

<p>This function creates an image element, sets the <code>src</code>
  depending on the <code>imageIndex</code> and puts the image into the div
  with the id given by <code>divId</code>.

<p>By having this as a separate function, we can test it by hand. Let's do
  that!  Open up a console and reload the page a few times until you get a
  small number of images, so there are lots of empty cells. The JS console
  will tell you which cells are in use, so you can play a perfect game if
  you want.  But suppose cells 0, 1 and 2 are empty.  Do this:
  <pre class="prettyprint lang-js linenums">
setOneImage(0,0);
setOneImage(0,1);
setOneImage(0,2);
</pre>

<p>That puts the same image (the first image) in all three cells. Now,
click on those cells.

<p>Now, let's look at what happens when you click on a cell:

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-js linenums">
function showImage() {
    // find div that was clicked to show in console
    var divId = this.getAttribute("id");
    console.log("Found "+divId);
    // alert("Found you!");
    this.classList.add("shown"); // makes the image visible
    foundByUser += 1;
    document.querySelector("#found").innerHTML = foundByUser;
}
</pre>

<p>Here's where we use the CSS trick to make the hidden image visible. 

<h2>Thought Question</h2>

<p>How could we count the number of clicks the person took?

<h2>Quiz Question Nr. 5</h2> 

<p>How could we cheat and get the page to say "Found 10 out of 9"
  <ol type="A">
    <li><pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
    document.querySelector("#found").innerHTML = "10 of 9";
      </pre>
    <li><pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
    document.querySelector("#total").innerHTML = "10 of 9";
      </pre>
    <li><pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
    document.querySelector("#total").innerHTML = 9;
    document.querySelector("#found").innerHTML = 10;
      </pre>
    <li><pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
    document.querySelector("#total").innerHTML = 10;
    document.querySelector("#found").innerHTML = 9;
      </pre>
  </ol>

  <ul>

    <li>connecting the JavaScript ideas and techniques to the making
    interactive web pages.
      
    <li>how to use the JavaScript console to test pieces of code
