<h1>Sound and Movies</h1>

<h2>Sound Waves</h2>

<P>Sound is produced by the <strong><em>vibration of an object in air or liquid</em></strong>

<p>Sound moves very fast through <strong><em>waves of pressure</em></strong>
(in air, 340 m/sec = 750 miles/hour)

<p><img src="soundwave.png" ALT="A signal is an undulating curve" width="600">

<p>The sound wave for a pure tone is characterized by its <strong><em>frequency</em>
(pitch)</strong> and <strong><em>amplitude</em> (loudness)</strong>

<p>Frequency is measured in <strong><em>Hz</em></strong> or <strong><em>cycles per 
second</em></strong>.  
Humans can hear frequencies between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz (20 KHz). Amplitude is measured 
in <strong><em>deciBels</em></strong>.

<h2>Analog vs. Digital Representations of Sound</h2>

<p>In an <strong><em>analog</em></strong> representation of sound, some physical property,
such as voltage, <strong><em>varies continuously</em></strong> in frequency and amplitude:

<blockquote><p><img SRC="analog-before.png"  ALT="the transmitted signal"></blockquote>

<p>An analog signal can be <strong><em>sampled</em></strong> to create a 
<strong><em>digital representation of sound:</em></strong>

<blockquote><p><img SRC="analog-sampling.png" ALT="dots drawn on the grid intersections nearest the curve"></blockquote>

<p>In a digital representation, the signal is conveyed by a sequence of discrete
numbers:
<blockquote style="margin-bottom: 20px"><p>
0 &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; 3 &nbsp; -4 &nbsp; -6 &nbsp; -2 &nbsp;  2 &nbsp; ...
</p></blockquote>

<p>
<img src="soundSample.png" alt="digitizing sound" width="250"
     style = "float: left; border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px 0 5px 5px;
              margin: 10px 20px 20px 10px">
<div style="margin-left: 270px">
<p>Two important factors in the sampling process affect <strong><em>sound 
quality</em></strong> and the <strong><em>file size</em></strong> needed to store audio 
signals:

<ul>
   <li><strong><em>sampling rate:</em></strong> number of samples per second (Hz),<br> 
    usually between 11 - 44.1 KHz
   <li><strong><em>bit-resolution:</em></strong> number of bits per sample,<br> 
    usually between 8 - 32 bits
</ul>
<p>The choice of sampling rate and bit-resolution depend in part on the type of audio
information being represented:
<ul>
   <li>speech in native language: 11 KHz, 8 bits
   <li>CD quality music: 44.1 KHz, 16 bits
</ul>
<p>How frequently should we sample? The <strong><em>Nyquist Sampling Theorem</em></strong> says:

<blockquote><p>Sample twice as often as the highest frequency you want to capture</p></blockquote>
</div>
<p style="clear: left;">When converting from a digital representation back to analog 
(e.g. listening through a speaker), the quality of the reconstructed signal 
(dashed curves below) depends on the original sampling rate:

<blockquote><p><img SRC="analog-reconstructed.png"  ALT="a reconstruction by drawing a curve through the dots"></blockquote>
         
<blockquote>
<p><img src="analog-reconstructed-improved.png"
 alt="a better reconstruction by drawing a curve through a dots on a finer grid">
</blockquote>

<p>High sampling rate and bit-resolution yield high quality sound, but require
<strong><em>large file sizes!</em></strong> 

<p>The <strong><em>bit-rate</em></strong> is the number of bits needed
to store 1 second of audio:

<blockquote style="border: 2px solid red; padding: 5px 20px; width: 550px;">
<p><strong>bit rate (bits per second) = bit-resolution x sampling rate</strong>
<p><strong>file size (in bits) = bit rate x recording time</strong>
</blockquote>

<p style="padding: 0 0 20px 0"><strong>How many bits in 1 second of stereo CD music?</strong> 

<p style="padding: 0 0 20px 0"><strong>How many bits in one hour of stereo CD music?</strong>

<!--         
 <blockquote>
 <p>16 bits per sample x 44100 samples per second x 1 second = 705,600 bits
 <p>705,600 bits / 8 bits per byte = 88,200 bytes &asymp; 88 KB
 </blockquote>
         
<P>For stereo, add another 88 KB for the second channel for a total bit-rate of
176 KB/second!

<p>For an hour of CD-quality stereo music

<blockquote>
<p>176 KB/sec x 3600 seconds/hour = 633,600 KB &asymp; 634 MB
</blockquote>

<p>634 MB is about the size of a CD &mdash; it's not accidental that a
CD can hold about 1 hour of music, it was designed that way!

<p><strong>Will we need to have such large file sizes for sound clips on our web pages?</strong>
No, thanks to <strong><em>audio compression techniques</em></strong>, used in file formats such as
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/whyqt/"> Quicktime</A>, AVI,
RealAudio and MP3.

<H2>Degradation</H2>
         
         <P>Any time signals are transmitted, there will be some
         degradation of quality:
         
         <OL>
            <LI>signals may fade with time and distance</LI>
            
            <LI>signals may get combined with interference from other
            sources (static)</LI>
            
            <LI>signals may be chopped up or lost</LI>
         </OL>
         
         <P>When we continue to transmit and transform signals, the
         effect is compounded. 

<p>However, <strong><em>digital transmission and storage</em></strong> of information 
allows the possibility for creating <strong><em>perfect (undegraded) copies</em></strong>
of the information, because we only need to distinguish 1's from 0's, and because errors
in transmission can be <a href="http://cs.wellesley.edu/~cs110/lectures/M07-analog-and-digital/#parity">
detected and corrected</a>.
