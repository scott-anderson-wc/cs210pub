    <h3>Introduction to Object Oriented Programming</h3>
    <hr>
    
    <h4>General Idea:</h4>
        
    <p>In JavaScript, an <b>object</b> is a kind of value that can have two important characteristics:</p>
        

    <p><b>State</b>: This is information describing the object. For example, a ball object could be the color red, have a radius of 12 inches, and have polka dots.</p>
    
    <p><b>Behavior</b>: This is the information describing the actions of the object. For instance, a ball object can bounce.</p>
        
    <p>In order to create specific objects, we need to create a JavaScript <b>class</b>.
     (Note that is different from the HTML classes!) Imagine a class as a general 
    grouping, and objects are the specific instances of that grouping. Here are some
    examples of classes and objects.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Class</b>: Ball</li>
            <ul>
            <li style="list-style: none;"><b>Objects</b>:</li>
            <li>Red, has a radius of 12, has polka dots, bounces</li>
            <li>Blue, has a radius of 5, does not have polka dots, bounces</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Class</b>: Wellesley College Student</li>
            <ul>
            <li style="list-style: none;"><b>Objects</b>:</li>
            <li>Beatrice, Class of 2019, MAS major, says "hello!"</li>
            <li>Jackie, Class of 2018, biology major, runs to lab</li>
            <li>Kate, Class of 2020, English major, sings</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

    <h3>Programming Classes and Objects</h3>
        
    <p>Let's make our ball object through JavaScript:</p>
        
    <pre><code>var Ball = function (color, radius, hasPolkaDots) {
    this.ballColor = color;
    this.ballRadius = radius;
    this.doesThisBallhavePolkaDots = hasPolkaDots;
};

Ball.prototype.bounce = function() {
  console.log("Booiiiiinng. Ball is bouncing");
};

var ball1 = new Ball("Purple", 12, true);
var ball2 = new Ball("Blue", 5, false);

ball1.ballColor  //Purple"
ball2.ballRadius  //5
ball2.doesThisBallhavePolkaDots  //false
</code></pre>
        
<p>Let's break the code into sections. The first 5 lines of this code is:</p>
        
<img src="images/constructor.png" alt="constructor">

<p>The <b>class name</b> is <code>Ball</code>, as indicated by the box and purple in the picture. Class names are always capitalized by convention. When creating a Ball, it needs to be given a color, a radius, and whether or not it has polka dots. This is indicated by the <b>parameters</b>. The key word <code>this</code> indicates that you are binding
the parameter (color, radius, hasPolkaDots) to the name of the <b>instance variable</b> (ballColor, ballRadius, doesThisBallHavePolkaDots). The instance variables describes the
properties or <b>state</b> of the object, as described earlier in this reading.</p>
        
<img src="images/method.png" alt="method">
        
<p>Just as instance variables describe state, <b>methods</b> describe the <b>behavior</b> of
the object. Here, the name of the method is bounce as indicated by the box and the purple. 
When a ball bounces, it logs "Booiiiiinng. Ball is bouncing." When you create new methods,
you always preface the function with the name of the class (in this case, Ball) and the key
word <code>prototype</code>.</p>
        

<img src="images/calling.png" alt="creating two ball objects, calling instance variables and methods">

<p>After you create the Ball class, you can create specific <b>instances</b> of Ball objects.
The first two lines of code create ball1 and ball2, each with its own characteristics.
The next three lines of code accesses the different instance variables. For example,
ball1 is purple. Finally, the last two lines of code access the method of the Ball class.
Both ball1 and ball2 have the method bounce, so they will both behave the same way.
Notice that when you access methods, you must use parenthesis at the end! (as shown by 
the orange).</p>
