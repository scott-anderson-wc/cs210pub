There are two possible prerequisites for CS 210, CS 115 or CS 111.  Since
the two classes follow different structures, for the first few lectures,
we will be separating the notes for two different audiences.</p>
      
However, note that you can read both links if you are interested. The CS
115 link will assume some JavaScript knowledge and explain programming
concepts more throughly, while the CS 111 link will compare
Python/JavaScript and their similarities and differences.</p>
