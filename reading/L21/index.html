      <h2 id="intro">Making the User Interface more appealing</h2>
      
      <p>As we discussed earlier in the semester, the way an HTML page interacts 
        with a user is through an HTML form and its elements (inputs, buttons, checkboxes,
        drop-down lists, radio buttons, etc.). However, the default look and feel
        of the HTML forms is very unappealing for today's web. And one would need to 
        write considerable amount of CSS rules to make it look better. Here is where 
        <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQuery UI</a>
        can help us, by providing a ready to use supply of styled elements as well as
        ways to incorporate them into our pages.</p>
        
        <p>jquery UI is a library of user interface (UI) plugins that offers interactions,
        widgets, and effects. Visit the links below if you are interested to see demos
          of all these plugins.</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Interactions </strong> are elements with which the user can interact
          to change their position in the page. They include <a href="http://jqueryui.com/draggable/">draggables</a>, 
          <a href="http://jqueryui.com/droppable/">droppables</a>, 
            <a href="http://jqueryui.com/sortable/">sortables</a>, 
            <a href="http://jqueryui.com/selectable/">selectables</a>
          and <a href="http://jqueryui.com/resizable/">resizables</a>. </li>
          <li><strong>Widgets</strong> are self-contained UI components that add certain functionalities
          to the page. They include <a href="http://jqueryui.com/dialog/">dialogs</a>, 
            <a href="http://jqueryui.com/menu/">menus</a>, <a href="http://jqueryui.com/tab/">tabs</a>,
          <a href="http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/">datepicker</a>, 
            <a href="http://jqueryui.com/progressbar">progressbar</a> and many more.</li>
          <li><strong>Effects</strong> are a series of plugins that allow us to do more animations with our 
          elements such as bouncing, shaking, exploding, pulsating, and more. To see
          demos of such effects <a href="http://jqueryui.com/effect/">visit this page</a> 
            and select an effect from the drop-down list.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="theme">Choosing and including jQuery UI</h2>
        <p>While including jQuery into our HTML files was easy (we simply set the <code>src</code>
        attribute of the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag to an absolute URL), for the jQuery UI we will
        need to do a bit more work, depending on how much customization for the UI we want.</p>
	<p>
	  In lab this week, you will learn how to set up your page to use jQuery UI.
	  </p>

        <div id="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
        <h4>No customization</h4>
        <p>If you are not planning on changing the look and feel of the jQuery UI plugins to
          match the color-scheme of your website, you can choose one of the existing CSS themes
          provided in the jQuery gallery, e.g., sunny, redmond, overcast, cupertino,
          vader, trontastic, and many more. Once you have decided on one of the themes, you 
          will need to use both the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>
          tags in your HTML, as shown below:</p>
          
        <pre>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.10.4/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css" /&gt;

&lt;script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.10.4/jquery-ui.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>        
        </div>
        
      <div id="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
      <h4>Customization for colors and library size</h4>  
      <p>Often, none of the existing themes in the gallery will match the color theme and visual
        look of your website. In that case you would like to roll your own theme, using the 
        <a href="http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/">Themeroller</a> provided by jQuery UI.</p> 
        <p>These are the steps you would need to follow in that case:</p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>Visit the <a href="http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/">ThemeRoller</a> page and 
          play with the colors, fonts, borders, backgrounds, etc. until you create the theme
          you desire.</li>
          <li>Click on the <strong>Download Theme</strong> button, which will direct you to 
          the <em>Download Builder</em> page.</li>
          <li>In this page, choose what widgets, interactions, or effects you want to be included,
          in addition to the jQuery UI core. Remember that the more you choose, the bigger will
          be the size of your library file. </li>
          <li>Click the <strong>Download</strong> button at the end of the page.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>The result will be a file, named <strong>jquery-ui-1.10.4.custom.zip</strong>, which
        will be downloaded onto your computer. </p>
</div>
        
        <p>Unzipping this file will create the <strong>jquery-ui-1.10.4.custom</strong> folder
        that has several subfolders and files (see image below). </p>
        
        <figure class="text-center">
          <img src="jqueryUI-folder.png" alt="screenshot of folder structure" class="img-thumbnail">
          <figcaption>The structure of the jquery-ui folder on your computer.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>Because now the jQuery UI code is on your own machine, you will need to move this folder
        to the folder of your HTML project, and use <strong>relative URLs</strong> to include the
        files you need into your HTML pages. Concretely, you will have to insert these two lines:</p>
        <pre>
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/jquery-ui-1.10.4.custom/css/custom-theme/jquery-ui-1.10.4.custom.css" /&gt;

&lt;script src="/jquery-ui-1.10.4.custom/js/jquery-ui-1.10.4.custom.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> The two lines above are in addition to the jQuery library
        itself, that you already have included.</p>
-->        
      <h2 id="examples">Examples of jQuery UI plugins</h2>
      
      <p>We have created a <a href="jqueryUI-ex.html">simple HTML page</a> that contains a 
         few jQuery UI widgets, effects, and interactions. </p>
         
      <p>The examples show how to:
         <ul>
            <li>Create an accordion and provide several options for its appearance and behavior.</li>
            <li>Create a menu of tabs and control their appearance.</li>
            <li>Style a button with an arrow and use it to slideToggle a div. The div contains draggable elements.</li>
            <li>Convert a set of radio buttons to a buttonset and use them to perform different
            effects on a div (shake, puff, bounce).</li>
            <li>Create a datepicker</li>
         </ul>         
      </p>
         
      <p>In including jQuery UI plugins in the page, two steps are necessary:
        <ol>
            <li>Create an HTML element with an attribute ID, so that it's unique on the page.</li>
           <li>Select the element with jQuery and apply to it the jQuery UI method that converts it into
           one of the plugins.</li>
         </ol> 
       Below are some code snippet that you'll find in the example page:  
      </p>
       
       <pre>
// Create the accordion
$( "#accordion" ).accordion();

// Create a tabs plugin
$("#tabs").tabs();

// Create a button widget that has an icon on the left side
$("#jumblegame button").button({
      icons: {
          secondary: "ui-icon-triangle-1-s"
      }
});

// Turn all spans of a div into draggable elements contained within a certain space
$('#dragarea span').draggable({containment: "#content"});

// Apply the "bounce" effect
$("#boxForEffects").effect("bounce", {distance: 50, times: 4}, 2000); 
</pre>
         
  <p>In addition to creating plain widgets, interactions, or applying effects, each of the
      jQuery UI methods takes options in the form of Javascript <em>literal objects</em>,
       that can provide more flexibility and control over the interaction experience.</p>  
       
   <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger">
      <h4>The importance of CSS in the UI</h4>
      <p>You remember that to use jQuery UI we did two things: linked to a CSS file and 
      included a JS file. Part of what a jQuery UI method does is to apply multiple CSS classes
      to our HTML elements, so that they look in a certain way. In the screenshot below, you
      can notice how the container of the tabs and every tab element have multiple CSS classes
      added dynamically. Recognizing that jQuery UI does this is important, because sometimes
      these default classes will make a plugin look in a way that doesn't suit your
      page. For example, a tabs plugin usually stretches across the whole page and to make it fit into a 
      certain section, we had to add some CSS to the class that controls its layout:</p>
      
      <pre>
.ui-tabs-nav {
      overflow: hidden;
} 
</pre>
   </div>
       
       <figure class="text-center">
         <img src="jqueryUI-css.png" alt="screenshot of CSS classes in jquery UI"
              class="img-thumbnail">
          <figcaption>The CSS classes added dynamically by the <code>.tabs()</code> method.</figcaption>
       </figure>
