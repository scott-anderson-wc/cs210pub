# Syllabus for CS 204

By <q>syllabus</q>, I mean the administrative aspects of the course. If
you're looking for the [day-to-day schedule](schedule/schedule.html),
follow that link.

I have borrowed many of the ideas for the syllabus from the syllabus for
CS 115, so if you took that course, some of this may be familiar to you.

## Prerequisites

CS 111. CS 115 is not sufficient.
  
## Staff

My name is Scott Anderson. Feel free to call me Scott. My office is in
E116 and my office phone is extension 3249, but the best way to reach me
is by email at `scott.anderson@wellesley.edu`. My [office hours for Fall
2019](https://cs.wellesley.edu/~anderson/#office-hours) are on my
[homepage](https://cs.wellesley.edu/~anderson/office-hours)

I'm also pleased to say that we have Sandra Xu (sxu5) and Heidi Cho
(hcho5) as tutors for the course.

* Heidi Cho will hold drop-ins on Tuesaday evenings from 9pm-11pm in E101.
* Sandra Xu will hold drop-ins on Wednesday evenings from 7pm-9pm in E101.

## Lectures

Each week there are two 75-minute lectures that will introduce the main
content of the course.  There is no lab, but we will do lab-like
activities in class. Please come prepared to do so.

Doing the class activities counts towards your class participation
grade. (See [Grading Policy](#grading-policy) below.

## Course Group

Please verify that you are registered to the <em>CS-204-01-FA19</em>
Google group. This group has several purposes. We will use it to make
class announcements, such as corrections to assignments and clarifications
of material discussed in class.

I encourage you to post questions or comments that are of interest to
students in the course. Please do not post significant amounts of
assignment-related JavaScript code (i.e. more than one or two lines of
code) in your messages on the group! The instructors and TAs will read
messages posted in the group on a regular basis and post answers to
questions found there. If you know the answer to a classmate's question,
feel free to post a reply yourself. The course group is also a good place
to find people to join a study group. You should plan on reading group
messages on a regular basis.

Join `CS-Students` if you want to hear about internships, talks, social
events and the like.

## Textbook

We will be using [Front-End Web Development by Chris Aquino and Todd
Gandee](https://www.bignerdranch.com/books/front-end-web-development/) as
our required text.  You can order it from Amazon and other vendors.


## Material from other CS courses

CS 204 was designed by including some of the material that were previously
taught in CS110. You may sometimes find that some document we assign
refers to that course. This is normal.

## Reading material and Quizzes

You are required to study the reading material assigned for each lecture
<em>before</em> you come to class, and respond to a quiz (administered via
Sakai) assigned for the class. This is important since that way we can
gear the classroom activities towards implementing examples and seeing
them in action, rather than starting from scratch. Of course, you are
encouraged to ask questions of any of the material.

## No Laptop Policy

To encourage conversation and collaboration, I ask you not to use your
laptops in class. We will use the college-supplied Macs with large
screens.  The fact that we are using a cloud-based IDE means that there
shouldn't be any need for you to store things on your laptop.

## Sakai

I will use Sakai to record and calculate your grades, including quiz
grades. Since you can check those grades securely, please do so, and let
me know if anything is incorrect.

## Gradescope

I may use [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/) to grade
assignments. That will involve an extra step of submitting a document to
Gradescope. Please keep that in mind.

## Exam

There will be a midterm exam. It will be a paper and pencil exam in which
you'll solve some problems that the assignments will prepare you for. Yes,
there will be some coding on the exam. I'll definitely grade the exam
using Gradescope.

## Final Project

There will be a final project in which you and a partner will build a
useful web application.

## Grading Policy

Your final grade for the course will be computed as a weighted average of
several components. One of them is class participation that includes
coming to lectures and doing the work, and actively participating in
discussions. 

The relative weight of each component is shown below:

<table>
<tr><th>component</th><th>percentage</th></tr>
<tr><td>Assignments</td><td>50%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Midterm Exam</td><td>15%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Participation</td><td>10%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Project</td><td>15%</td></tr>
<tr><td>Quizzes</td><td>10%</td></tr>
</table>

## Grading Scale

Numerical grades are converted to letters using the following scale:

<table>
<tr><th>min</th><th>letter</th></tr>
<tr><td> >= 95 </td><td> A      </td></tr>
<tr><td> >= 90 </td><td> A-     </td></tr>
<tr><td> >= 87 </td><td> B+     </td></tr>
<tr><td> >= 83 </td><td> B      </td></tr>
<tr><td> >= 80 </td><td> B-     </td></tr>
<tr><td> >= 77 </td><td> C+     </td></tr>
<tr><td> >= 73 </td><td> C      </td></tr>
<tr><td> >= 70 </td><td> C-     </td></tr>
<tr><td> >= 60 </td><td> D      </td></tr>
</table>

## Lateness Policy

Because it's both important to do the work but also to avoid falling
behind, I'm establishing the following lateness policy.

I do plan to go over assignment solutions in class, as a useful learning
experience.

Each assignment will have up to 4 lateness coupons, good for a free,
one-day, no-excuses extension. This will allow you to turn the assignment
in as late as the following Sunday at midnight if your life has *blown up*
in some difficult way, but it will allow me to discuss the solution the
following Tuesday in class. If for some reason you haven't completed the
solution by then, contact me and we can work something out.

## Time and Work

For Wellesley to be accredited, each course credit should correspond to a
minimum of 12 hours of work, including class time, homework and reading
outside class, and so forth.  Therefore, you should plan to spend, on
average, about 12 hours per week on this course. 

Time is limited. Some of us have more than others, but it is always
finite. I will try hard to keep this course from taking more than about 12
hours of your time each week.

Programming is always time consuming, and it's often hard to predict how
long a task will take. Sometimes I fix a bug in five minutes, and
sometimes I think about it the wrong way and it takes five hours to
squash.

The preceding facts are difficult to reconcile. Some students are willing
and able to put tremendous amounts of time into an assignment, working
well beyond the prescribed limits. Other students don't, either because
they have other obligations (paid work, for example) or other priorities
(sports, clubs, organizations and so forth). I don't believe that a
student should be disadvantaged in my class because they are unable or
unwilling to put in excessive amounts of time. And I'm going to aim for
about 12 hours per week. So, here is my current policy:

* I will try my best to design assignments that will not take more than
  8 hours to do. That allows two hours of class time and two hours of
  reading and other preparation outside of class to hit the 12 hour target.
* Each student is required to report how much time they spent on an
  assignment. This requirement will be part of turning in the assignment.
  The data allows me to see how I am meeting my goal and allows me to
  revise the assignment for the next time the course is taught.
* I ask students to *stop* working on the assignment once they have
  hit the time limit. Turn in what you have and go do other
  things.
* Furthermore, spend your assignment time wisely. If you've spent
  significant time and given
  a good faith effort at fixing a bug and you haven't yet fixed it, *stop*
  and *get help*. 

## Collaboration Policy

Here is overview on our collaboration policy, and it is followed by a more
detailed explanation below:

* Assignments: Rotating pairs of students
* Project: Pairs of students
* Exams: Absolutely no collaboration

## Collaboration on Assignments

I believe that collaboration fosters a healthy and enjoyable educational
environment. For this reason, I encourage you to talk with other students
about the course material and to form study groups.

Programming assignments in this course can be challenging. Also teamwork
is the norm in the CS industry. Given the above, some of the assignment
work is required to be done with a partner, while some is required to be
done individually. In each assignment tasks will be clearly marked as
either "individual" or "pair-programming". The two team members must work
closely together on the pair-programming tasks.

I will assign pairs.

Pair-programming tasks are subject to the following ground rules:

* The work must be a true collaboration in which each member of the team
  will carry her own weight. It is not acceptable for two team members to
  split the work between them and work independently.
* The fact that team members have to program together means that you need
  to carefully consider a potential partner's schedule before forming a
  team. You cannot be an effective team if you cannot find large chunks of
  time to spend at a computer together!
* Working with different partners is a good way to build community in the
  class. We strongly recommend that you pair up with several other
  students during the semester.

In general, teams are allowed to discuss assignment tasks with other
teams and exchange ideas about how to solve them. However, there is a
thin line between collaboration and plagiarizing the work of
others. 

## Honor Code

Each team or individual student must compose their own solution to each
task. Discussing strategies and approaches with classmates and receiving
general debugging advice from them is acceptable and encouraged. However
you (and your partner) are required to write and debug all of your
code. Furthermore, you should never look at another student's code.  For
example, it is OK to borrow code from the textbook, from materials
discussed in class, and from other sources as long as you give proper
credit. However, it is unacceptable and constitutes a violation of the
Honor Code (1) to write a program together with someone not part of your
team and turn in two copies of the same program, (2) to copy code written
by your classmates, (3) to read another student's or team's code or (4) to
view assignments, exams and solutions from previous terms of the course.
In keeping with the standards of the scientific community, you must give
credit where credit is due. If you make use of an idea that was developed
by (or jointly with) others, please reference them appropriately in your
work. It is unacceptable for students to work together but not to
acknowledge each other in their write-ups.  

## Accommodation

It is my goal that *every* student in this course succeed, regardless of
whatever challenges they may face. That includes documented disabilities
and conditions, as well as other challenges.

If you have a disability or condition, either long-term or
temporary, and need reasonable academic adjustments in this course,
please contact Disability Services to get a letter outlining your
accommodation needs, and submit that letter to me. You should request
accommodations as early as possible in the semester, or before the
semester begins, since some situations can require significant time
for review and accommodation design. If you need immediate
accommodations, please arrange to meet with me as soon as possible. If
you are unsure but suspect you may have an undocumented need for
accommodations, you are encouraged to contact Disability Services.
They can provide assistance including screening and referral for
assessments.  Disability Services can be reached at
disabilityservices@wellesley.edu, at 781-283-2434, by scheduling an
appointment online at their website www.Wellesley.edu/disability , or
by visiting their offices on the 3rd floor of Clapp Library, rooms 316
and 315.

If you have special needs of any kind, please meet with me to discuss 
accommodations that may be helpful to you.

If you have special needs of any kind, please meet with me to discuss
accommodations that may be helpful to you. I want to make this course
successful for everyone.

## Responsible Employee

Pursuant to Wellesley College policy, all employees, including
faculty, are considered responsible employees. That means that any
disclosure of discrimination, harassment, or sexual misconduct to a
faculty member will need to be shared with the College's Director of
Non-Discrimination Initiatives / Title IX and ADA / Section 504
Coordinator, Sonia Jurado (781-283-2451;
sjurado@wellesley.edu). Students who do not wish to have these issues
disclosed to the College should speak with confidential resources who
are the only offices at the College that do not have this same
reporting obligation. On campus, confidential resources include Health
Services (781-283-2810 available 24/7), the Stone Center Counseling
Services (781-283-2839 available 24/7) and the Office of Religious and
Spiritual Life (781-283-2685). You should assume that any person
employed on campus outside of these three confidential offices has an
obligation to share information with Wellesley College through the
Office of Non-Discrimination Initiatives.

## How to succeed in the course

* Prepare to spend about 12 hours every week.
* Attend all lectures, quit all social media while in class.
* Read the assigned material and slides BEFORE attempting to do the quiz or the assignment.
* Submit your quiz answers before class.
* Read assignment description immediately, start thinking about it ASAP, not 1-2 days before it is due!
* Start assignments early, be prepared to make mistakes.
* Programming is a skill: The best programmers have made every mistake in the books!
* Programming is hard: Do not blame yourself for your mistakes; just give yourself more time!
* Programming requires *resilience*
