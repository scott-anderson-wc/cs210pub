<H1>A History of Computing through Representation</H1>

<P>In this lecture we will discuss the history of computing and explain
why it is really a sequence of ideas in representing data, operations, and
instructions. <!--In addition we will discuss the development of hypertext
from an abstract (and rather crazy) idea in the 1940's to the world wide
web we are using every day.--></P>


<H2>What is a computer?</H2>

<P>A calculating device that can follow detailed instructions.</P>

<P>Note that this definition does not restrict computers to the
digital devices we use these days.  Computers weren't
always digital, and they may not be digital in the future. </p>

<P>To create a computer one needs a way to represent 
<UL>
	<LI><STRONG>data</STRONG> (such as numbers, letters, and/or other symbols), 	
	<LI><STRONG>instructions</STRONG> that tell the computer what to do.  There are two kinds of instructions:
            <UL>
         	<LI><STRONG>data manipulation instructions</STRONG>
  		(such as addition and multiplication, to manipulate
		data), and 
		<LI><STRONG>control instructions</STRONG> (to describe
		how to sequence operations, such as with
		<code>if</code>-<code>then</code>, as we'll see 
		below). 
            </UL>


</UL>

<P>Of course, modern computers manipulate much more than numbers and
symbols: They can deal with objects such as images, movies, animations,
sound, etc.  
<!-- [10/19/08] MAS commented this out.  We've already seen images.  And why 
     constrain where this is in the syllabus.

   We'll be examining them later in the course.</P>

<H2>Some of the Representations so far...</H2>

<P>People have used a variety of materials over the years for these
representations. In a sense, the history of computing is a history of
representations. The table below shows just a few of the devices people
have used over the centuries to compute. As you can see, they have used a
variety of objects to represent numbers, operations and instructions. </P>

For another version of this history, see the 
Wikipedia entry on <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing_hardware">the
history of computing hardware</a>.  You can also look up the various
devices on the web.

         A vacuum tube allows electricity to move only in one
      direction. It turns out that this is an essential characteristic for
      electronic computers. But a vacuum tube is relatively
      large. Machines with hundreds of thousands of vacuum tubes were
      built, taking up space of several floors in big buildings, and
      consuming huge amounts of energy.  </TD>

<p>One thing is certain, that there is a human desire for the highest
computational power possible. But it is not clear today how faster
machines will be developed. We understand that we cannot keep on creating
faster <STRONG>uni-processor</STRONG> computers. We need some kind of
<STRONG>multi-processor</STRONG> computers. Today, you can buy a computer
with two or four processors that work independently.
