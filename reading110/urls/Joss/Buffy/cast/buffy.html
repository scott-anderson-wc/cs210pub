<h1>Buffy</h1>

<p>The main character is, of course, Buffy Summers, played by Sarah
Michelle Gellar.  Her best friend, from the very first episode, is <a
href="willow.html">Willow Rosenberg</a>, who has developed her powers of
witchcraft and will probably play an important role in <a
href="../plot.html">the plot of season 6</a>.  

<p>Buffy's been quite in love with <a href="angel.html">Angel</a>, much to
the chagrin of Alexander (Xander) Harris.

<p>Buffy is quite different from the other slayers, including the one in
      the <a href="../../comics.html">comics</a>
