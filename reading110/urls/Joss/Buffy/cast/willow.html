<h1>Willow</h1>

Willow is Buffy's best friend, a shy, geeky woman who had, for many
seasons, a crush on Xander Harris (who, naturally, had a crush on Buffy),
then fell in love with Oz (who, supernaturally, is a werewolf), but now is
deeply in love with Tara (who, sadly, got her mind damaged by Glory).
