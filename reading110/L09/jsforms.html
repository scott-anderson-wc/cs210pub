          <h2 id="js">How Javascript works</h2>
          <p>Whenever the browser fetches an HTML page from a web server, it will
          parse its content starting from the beginning to the bottom. When it completes
          this process, it creates an internal model of the HTML page, called the DOM. </p>
          <p>The DOM is a tree representation of the HTML page, as we have discussed before.
          Then, during the interaction with the page, Javascript uses the DOM to perform
          actions upon the document (e.g. change its appearance) or handle user events.</p>
          
          <figure>
            <img src="images/js_model.png" alt="how javascript works">
            <figcaption>The model of how Javascript works on the browser. Graphics appears
            on page 36 of the book <a href="">Head First HTML5 Programming</a>.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          
          <h2 id="dom">Accessing the DOM</h2>
          <p>To access the DOM, we use the variable name <code>document</code>. Because the variable
          is already created when the page is loaded, there is no need for us to define it, we 
          will simply use it. You can try this out on the Console, by typing <code>document</code>
          and seeing that you get as a result the whole HTML document tree.</p>
          
          <p>Most of the time, we are interested not in the whole document, but only in one of
          its elements. Therefore, we need a way to access such elements. This is very similar
          to what we needed to do when applying CSS to our page. In that occasion, we used the 
          tag names and the id and class attributes. The <code>document</code> object (we will discuss
          soon what an object is), has several built-in methods that allow us to do the same in Javascript.</p>
          
          <p>Here is a list of some of such methods:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>document.getElementById</li>
            <li>document.getElementsByClassName</li>
            <li>document.getElementsByTagName</li>
            <li>document.getElementsByName</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>However, these methods restrict us on working only with elements that have an
          id, class, or name attribute. As we discussed in CSS, sometimes we need to use
          more complex selectors in order to access either nested elements or pseudo-classes.
          Since CSS3, we can use two new Javascript methods <code>document.querySelector</code>
          and <code>document.querySelectorAll</code>, that allow us to use the same selector
          names used in CSS. Let's see some examples:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><code>document.querySelector("p.authorName")</code></li>
            <li><code>document.querySelector("#main")</code></li>
            <li><code>document.querySelector('#myform input[type="radio"]:checked')</code></li>
            <li><code>document.querySelector("#content img:nth-of-type(1)")</code></li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Because this method is much faster than the other methods and allows us to keep
          our HTML clean of id and class attributes on every element, we will make very frequent
          use of it in our examples.</p>
          
          <p>In fact, you might remember that we used this method in a few examples in the Javascript 
          lecture, such as the <a href="http://cs.wellesley.edu/~cs110/lectures/JSProgramming/#quest">
            grail quest</a>.</p>
          
          <h2 id="handlers">Event Handlers</h2>
          <p>As we discussed in the section of <a href="forms1.html#events">Event Attributes</a>, 
            in order to interact with a page,
          we need to write so-called <em>event handlers</em>, which are Javascript code that is 
          executed when an event is triggered. When the event handling code is short, it can 
          be written as an inline attribute value for the event attribute. Otherwise, it needs
          to be wrapped inside the body of a <em>function</em> which either will need to be 
          associated with the event attribute inline or through some more complex code. We will
          see all these scenarios in the following.</p>
          
          <h3>Inline Event Handlers</h3>
          <p>An inline event handler looks like the example below:</p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-9">
              <pre>
&lt;button <strong>onclick</strong>="alert('I was clicked!');"&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;
</pre>
              </div>
            
          <div class="col-md-3">
              <br>
              <p><button onclick="alert('I was clicked!');">Click me</button></p>
            </div>
          </div>
         <p>Notice the <em>event attribute</em> <code>onclick</code>, to which we attached the
            <em>event handler</em> code that will display an alert pop-up dialog.</p> 
            
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
  <h4>The special variable <code>this</code></h4>
  <p>Whenever an event occurs, the browser knows not only what kind of event happened (a click, a key press, etc.)
    but also the element that the event happened to. Such an element is called the <em>target</em> of the
    event. In such cases, through some Javascript magic, the target element can be referred within the event
    handler with the special variable name <code>this</code>.
    
    <p>Some examples are shown in the following.</p>
</div>
          
                    <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-10">
              <pre>
&lt;button <strong>onclick</strong>="alert(<strong>this.innerHTML</strong> + ' was clicked.');"&gt;Winter&lt;/button&gt;
</pre>
              </div>
            
          <div class="col-md-1">
              <br>
              <p><button onclick="alert(this.innerHTML + ' was clicked.');">Winter</button></p>
            </div>
          </div>
         <p>Notice how clicking on the button, displays the text that is enclosed within 
           the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> element. By making use of the special variable
          <code>this</code>, we can create very interesting effects, such as making things appear and
          disappear, changing images, creating drop-down menus, etc. We will study this examples later
          this semester. Here is a very simple one that changes the color of text.</p> 
          
                              <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-10">
              <pre>
&lt;span <strong>onmouseover</strong>="<strong>this.style.color='blue'</strong>;"&gt;Wellesley College&lt;/span&gt;
</pre>
              </div>
            
          <div class="col-md-2">
              <p><span onmouseover="this.style.color='blue';">Wellesley College</span></p>
            </div>
          </div>
          
         <p>Writing inline event handlers makes sense only if we are doing something very simple, small,
          and that applies to a single element. Very often though, we want to perform more complex
          operations within the Javascript event handler, which might not need user interaction (for example, 
           the code executes when the pages loads) or that it applies to many HTML elements (for example
           to all images in a gallery). 
          
        <p>You might say that we can solve this problem by entering our code within the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>
          tag. However, that will not be enough. This is because everything inside that tag will be executed
          in the moment the HTML document is loaded by the browser (remember, the code is parsed from the beginning
          to end and all Javascript portions are executed). In such cases, we need to have a special way
          of defining our code so that it cannot be executed immediately, but only when an event is triggered. 
          This special way of organizing code is know as a <em>function</em>.</p>
          
        <h2 id="functions">Functions</h2>
         <p>A function allows us to package up many lines of code in one chunk, give it a name, and invoke it 
           whenever we want. Invoking a function means to run it (execute the code). You have seen
          several examples of Javascript built-in functions so far, <code>alert()</code>, <code>prompt()</code>,
          <code>parsetInt()</code>, etc. The difference is going to be that we will have to define our own
          functions and then invoke them.</p> 
       
          
      <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-9">

              <pre>
&lt;script&gt;
<strong>function</strong> greetings(){
    var inputField = document.querySelector("[name='firstName']");
    var name = inputField.value // read value from input 
    alert("Nice to meet you, " + name);
}
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;input name="firstName"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;button <strong>onclick</strong>="greetings();"&gt;Greet me!&lt;/button&gt;
</pre>
              </div>
        <script>
        function greetings(){
    var inputField = document.querySelector("[name='firstName']");
    var name = inputField.value // read value from input 
    alert("Nice to meet you, " + name);
}
        </script>
          <div class="col-md-3">
              <br>
              <p><input name="firstName"></p>
              <button onclick="greetings();">Greet me!</button></p>
            </div>
      </div>
   
        <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
          <h4>Understanding functions</h4>
          Functions are one of the most important building blocks of a program, but they are
          a bit hard to understand for novices. This is because using them involves two steps:
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Declaring the function</strong> - this means specifying a blocks of code
            that has a name and a body of many lines.</li>
            <li><strong>Invoking the function</strong> - this means simply using the name of the function
            with the pair of parentheses.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <h4>Explore on your own</h4>
        Open the Console and copy one line at a time the code within the body of <code>greetings()</code>.
        Whenever you declare a variable, type then its name to see its value in the Console. 
        Do you see what the program does? Do you see the method <code>document.querySelector</code> 
        in action? The attribute <code>value</code>?
