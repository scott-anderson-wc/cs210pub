<H2 id="image_rep">Image Representation</H2>
<a name="pixel"></a>
         
<P>Now that we know how to represent a color, we can represent
<em>images</em>.  You can think of an image as a rectangular 2D grid
of spots of pure color, each represented as RRGGBB.  A spot of pure
color is called a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel"><b>pixel</b></a>, short for
picture element, the atom of a picture. Pixels are better seen if you
blow up an image several times; here are <a href="110_images.pdf">some examples</a>. 
<!--Check out the following <A HREF="graphics.pdf">description of pixels</A> on page 44.-->
         
<P>Every image on the computer monitor is represented with pixels,
including the windows themselves! Such images are saved in files that,
in addition to the image data, contain information on the size of the
image, the set of colors used, the origin of the image, etc. Depending
on how exactly this information is saved, we refer to them as <strong>image
formats</strong>. GIF, JPG, PNG, and BMP are some of the well-known
image formats.  We will talk more about image formats below.  For
now, we will focus on the number of pixels and the representation of
each pixel, and consequently, the file size of the image.

<p>We said above that the amount of each primary color is a number
from 0 to 255<sub>10</sub> or 00 to FF<sub>16</sub>.  It is no
coincidence that this is exactly one byte (8 bits).  A byte is a
convenient chunk of computer memory, so one byte was devoted to
representing the amount of a single primary color.  Thus, it takes 3
bytes (24 bits) to represent a single spot of pure color.

<div class="alert alert-info">With 256 values for each primary,
that yields 256 x 256 x 256 = 16,777,216 colors.  Humans can distinguish
over 10 million colors, so 24-bit color is sufficient to represent more
colors than humans can distinguish.  All modern monitors use this
so-called 24-bit color.  Some old monitors used 16-bit or 8-bit color,
which were relatively impoverished, being only able to represent 65,536
colors (for a 16-bit monitor) or 256 colors (for an 8-bit monitor).  Of
course, a black-and-white monitor can only represent two colors, which
could be called 1-bit color.</div>
         
<!--P>Since each pixel takes 24 bits (3 bytes), depending on the pixel amount
  of your device, a picture might require a lot of space to be stored.
  <to represent, even a small picture can require a surprising amount of space.

<blockquote id="pic1"><p>Example: A good monitor might have 100 pixels to
the inch, so a picture the size of a 3x5 index card would be 300 pixels by
500 pixels.  That's a total of 300x500=150,000 pixels.  Since each pixel
takes 3 bytes, the file size for the image is at least
         
<blockquote><p>300 x 500 x 3 = 450,000 bytes</blockquote>

<P>This is about 450 kilobytes (abbreviated kB, the "k" is lowercase, but
  the <q>B</q> is uppercase; see
  the <a href="../compModel/how_computer_works.html#bits_bytes">note on
  abbreviations</a>) or nearly half a megabyte. Not only is that a lot of
  storage space, but more importantly it takes significant time to
  download unless your modem is very fast. For example, if you have an
  old-style telephone modem that can only handle 56kbps (56k bits per second) =
  7kBps (7k bytes per second), you will need a little over 1 minute to
  download it (recall that 1 byte = 8 bits).  That's a lot of time.

</blockquote>

<p>Telephone modems?  Yes, some people still use telephone modems. 
But faster DSL modems (ranging from 128 kbps to 1500kbps) and 
cable modems (ranging from 300 kbps to 6000kbps) have become very popular. 

<p>However, the advent of faster connection speeds has been accompanied
by the rise of websites with content (higher-resolution photos, songs, videos) 
that completely consumes the additional bandwidth. 
So no one ever has enough network bandwidth, and it's wise to avoid
squandering it. If someone in your audience finds your website
slow to download, they'll move on to another website.>

<div class="ex"><span class="ex">Exercise 3</span>

<p>On the first day of class, Scott took approximately 30 
digital pictures of students, each of which was about 2MB.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
<h4>Image size and download time</h4>
  Every pixel needs 24 bits or 3 bytes to be stored. Let's suppose you are going
  to take pictures of all your 30 class peers for a class website, using your 
  iPhone4 camera. According to the 
  <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/apple_iphone_4-3275.php">phone specifications</a>, 
  its screen has 2592 x 1936 pixels, which amounts to about 5 million pixels, or 5MP.
  (The size of one pixel is 1.75 Âµm.) Thus, if every pixel takes 3 bytes, and a photo
  with your camera has 5MP, to store the image you need 15MB (mega bytes). For all
  your peer photos, you will need 30 x 15MB = 450 MB.
  <p>Imagine now that you put all these photos online on your website, in one
  single page (using the attributes width and height to make them fit in one screen), and
  then you send the link to this page to your parents. They might have an average
  Internet connection (e.g. Verizon offers offers a 1-3 Mbs (mega bit per second)
  to non-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIOS">FiOS</a> subscribers). </p>
  <p>The amount of time that it will take to load a page with all these pictures on 
  your parent's computer can be calculated as below:</p>
  
  <code>content size (450MB) x 8 bits/byte / 1Mbs = 3600 seconds or 1 hour.</code>
  
  <p>If each of your photos would have been around 100KB (as we asked you in HW2),
  then the amount of time to load all of them on the page would have been 24 seconds.</p>
  
  <p>So, how do we get our images to be so small in size? There are two ways: <em>resizing</em> 
  (decrease the amount of pixels for the image) and you have already seen this in lab, 
  and <em>compressing</em> (decreasing the amount of bytes per pixel) and we will discuss
  this in the next section.</p>
  </div>


<H2 id="compression">Compression</H2>

<p>Short of making our images smaller (fewer pixels), what can we do
to speed up the downloads?  We can <em>compress</em> the files.


<p>There are two classes of compression techniques:

<ul>

  <li>lossless compression, where clever encoding allows the number of
  bytes to be reduced but where the original image can be perfectly
  reconstructed from the compressed form, and

  <li>lossy compression, where we discard less-important information
  in order to reduce the amount of information to be stored or
  transmitted.

</ul>

<p>We will look in detail at one kind of lossless compression, which
is indexed color (GIF encoding), because it gives us a window into the
kinds of ideas and techniques that matter in designing
<em>representations</em> of information.

<h2 id="indexed">Indexed Color</h2>
         
<p>The idea behind indexed color is that if a particular color is used
many times in an image, we can create a "shorthand" for it.  In fact,
if we limit the number of colors, each one can be assigned a
shorthand.  What will be confusing is that the colors are, of course,
represented as numerals and so are the shorthands!  For example,
instead of saying (for the umpteenth time), color #D619E0, we'll just
say, for example, color number 5. This will only work, however, if the
shorthands really are shorter.  They are, and we'll see exactly how
much.

<P>One way to think about indexed color is that we are
<EM>creating</EM> a <A
HREF="http://pbskids.org/zoboo/mysteryanimal/paintbynumber/paintbynumber2.html">"paint-by-numbers"</A>
picture. We choose:
         
<OL>
            <LI>the numbered list of colors
            
            <LI>what color (number) each pixel is

</OL>
         
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
<h4>Example: Two-color image</h4>  
Imagine that a 300x500 picture uses only two colors,
say red and yellow. Suppose we make up a table of colors (two entries)
and then represent the image with an array of "color indexes," like a
paint-by-numbers set.

<UL>
  <li>What is the numbered list of colors?  There are just two:
  <table border="1">
    <tr><th>index</th><th>color</th></tr>
    <tr><td>0</td><td>#FF0000</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td>#FFFF00</td></tr>
  </table>

  <li>We then paint the picture using just two numbers, 0 and 1.  A
  zero means a pixel is red, and a one means the pixel is yellow.

  <li>How many bits does it take to represent this image?  Well, there
  are 300x500 or 150,000 pixels, but each one is just 1 bit, so it
  takes 150,000 bits or 150,000/8 = 18,750 bytes or about 18 kB.
  Compare that with the 450 kB (300 x 500 x 3 byte/pixel) of the 
  normal representation, and you can see
  this is <em>much</em> smaller.  In fact, it's 1/24<sup>th</sup> the
  size, since each pixel takes 1 bit to represent rather than 24.
  It'll be 24 times faster to download.

  <li>What about that table of colors?  That's called the <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palette_(computing)"><em>color
  palette</em></a>, by analogy with an artist's palette.  That has to
  be represented too.  Otherwise, the browser would know there were
  only two colors in the picture, but wouldn't know what colors they
  are. There are two entries in this palette, each of which is 3 bytes
  (24 bits), so add at least 6 more bytes to the representation.
            
</ul>
</div>

<p>You can see the general scheme at work: we create a table of all
the colors used in the picture.  The shorthand for a color is simply
its index in the table.  We will limit the table so that the
shorthands will be at most 8 bits.  Since the shorthands are all
replacing 24-bit color specifications, the shorthand is <em>at
most</em> one-third the size.  In the example above, the shorthand is
1/24th the size.

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
<h4>Example: Four-color image</h4>  
<p>Let's continue with the example.  What is the
file size if the image uses 4 colors, say red, yellow, blue and lime?
In that case, the table looks like this:

  <table border="1">
    <tr><th>index</th><th>color</th></tr>
    <tr><td>00</td><td>#FF0000</td></tr>
    <tr><td>01</td><td>#FFFF00</td></tr>
    <tr><td>10</td><td>#0000FF</td></tr>
    <tr><td>11</td><td>#00FF00</td></tr>
  </table>
            
  <p>As you can see, the shorthand is now two bits instead of one.
  Therefore, the 150,000 pixels require 300,000 bits or
  300,000/8=37,500 bytes or about 37.5kB.  Obviously, this is about
  twice the size of the previous example, since each shorthand is now
  twice as big.  Nevertheless, it's still much smaller than the 450 kB
  uncompressed file.

  <p>What about the size of the palette?  That's now twice as big,
  too.  Four entries at 3 bytes each adds 12 bytes to the file size,
  which is a negligible increase to the 37.5 kB.
</div>

<p>What's the pattern here?  The number of colors in the original
image determines the size of the palette, which determines the number
of bits in each shorthand, which then determines the size of the file
as a whole.  The shorthand for a color is simply the binary numeral
for the row that the color is in the table.  For example, the color
red in the last example was in row zero (00 in binary) and the color
lime was in row 3 (11 in binary).  
  
<p>However, the relationship between
the number of colors and the size of the shorthand is not an obvious
one.  Let's do one more example before we state the rule.

<blockquote id="pic4"><p>Suppose that the same 300x500 image uses 16
colors, say sixteen of the named colors that encountered in the <a href="colors.html">colors</a> lecture.  
In that case, the table looks like this:

</TABLE>
  
  <br>
  <p>As you can see, the shorthand is now four bits.  Therefore, the
  150,000 pixels require 600,000 bits or 600,000/8=75,000 bytes or
  about 75 kB.  Larger, but still much smaller than the 450 kB
  uncompressed file.

  <p>What about the size of the palette?  Sixteen entries at 3 bytes
  each adds 48 bytes to the file size.
</blockquote>
  
<p>You can see that the number of bits required for each pixel is the
key quantity. This quantity is called bits per pixel or "bpp."  It's
also often called "bit depth" so that the <strong>file size of an image</strong> is
just <code>width x height x bit depth</code>, almost as if it were a
physically 3D box.

<p>Finally, we can state the rule:

<blockquote><p>The bit depth of an image must be large enough so that the
   number of rows in the table is enough for all the colors.  If the bit
   depth is <em>d</em>, the number of rows in the table is 2<sup>d</sup>.
</blockquote>

<p>Here's the exact relationship, along with the size of a 300x500 image:


         <table border=1>
         <caption>Mapping bit-depth to number of colors</caption>
         <tr><th>bit-depth</th><th>max colors</th><th>file size of 300x500 image</th></tr>

         </table>

<H3>GIF Indexed Color</H3>
         

<IMG SRC="images/color-palette.gif" WIDTH=222 HEIGHT=139 ALT="sample GIF color palette">
         
<P>The GIF file format (i.e., image representation) is the best known example of indexed color format.
Here is how it works: Imagine a mural painter who will go to your house and paint a mural on
your wall, anything you want. But there's a catch: she'll only make one
trip to your house, and her van only holds 256 cans of paint. She has a
warehouse of 16 million cans of paint, and you can choose any 256 that you
want, but you can't have a mural with more than 256 different colors in
it.
         
<P>This is the essential idea behind GIF images and indexed color.

<h2 id="computingFileSize">Computing File Size</h2>

<p>We've learned how indexed color works and how it affects file size.
This is important not only for the theoretical understanding of why
representations matter, but also for the practical usefulness of
understanding how to reduce the sizes of your images.  In this section,
we'll review how to compute the approximate size of an indexed-color (GIF)
image.  Why do we do this?  Because it combines all the conceptual issues
into one small calculation.

<!-- [lyn, 3/10/09] 
     In the GIF section, added a paragraph explaining that there are many more
     details to GIF images and give pointers to explanations.
  -->
<!--
<p>Note that there are many additional details affecting the size of GIF images that we will not cover here. One detail is a certain amount of <em>fixed overhead</em> for representing information like the file type (so that the computer can tell it's a GIF image and not a JPEG, PNG or even a DOC file), and a few bytes to store the <em>dimensions</em> of the image (its width and height and the number of colors).  Another detail is that the bits representing the pixels can be compressed further (in a lossless way)
using a standard bit-compression algorithm.  
And GIF images support transparency and animations as well. 
For more information see 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Interchange_Format">this
summary</a>
and <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/format/gif/egff.htm">this
detailed explanation of GIF file format</a>.  We will not be concerned
with these details. We will focus on the relationship between the file
size and the dimensions of the image, including the number of colors.-->
         
<p>A key concept in the computation is the <em>bit-depth</em> of the
image. Read on page 19 the definition
of <A HREF="graphics.pdf">bit-depth</A>.  It's the number of bits
necessary to represent the desired number of colors.  Remember that the
number of colors is <strong>2<sup>d</sup></strong>, where <strong>d</strong> is the bit depth.  It's an
<em>exponential</em> relationship.  Adding just one bit to the
bit-depth <em>doubles</em> the number of colors you can have.

<p>Recall that the GIF representation comes in two parts: 

<ol>
  <li>the pixels
(represented by their shorthand values, each of size equal to the
bit-depth), and 
<li>the palette (in which the full-color definition is given for
each shorthand).  
    </ol>

<p>Thus, our computation breaks down into two parts.

  <ol>
    <li>The size for just the pixels is essentially the number of pixels,
    multiplied by the size of each.  We divide by 8 because bit-depth is
    in <em>bits</em> but file sizes are expressed in <em>bytes</em>.
    Since a byte equals 8 bits, we divide by 8.

      <!-- We use a table here so that the border is snug around the formula, instead of being defined by the container.  --> 

<table><tr><td class="formula">
<p>width * height * bit-depth / 8
</td></tr></table>

    <li>The size for the palette is the number of colors multiplied
    by the 3 bytes needed to represent each color:

<table><tr><td class="formula">
<p>num_colors * 3
</td></tr></table>

  </ol>

<p>To find the rough size of an image, we first determine the
bit-depth, then we compute the file size using the two formulas above.
(This is the <q>rough</q> size because, remember, we are omitting some
fixed overhead and further compression techniques.)  You can combine
them into one formula:

<table><tr><td class="formula">
<p>(width * height * bit-depth) / 8 + (3 * num-colors)
</td></tr></table>

<p>Finally, because the file size will usually be large (thousands or
millions of byte), we divide by 1000 or 1,000,000 to convert to
kilobytes or megabytes, as appropriate.
  
  
  <h2 id="formats">Image File Formats</h2>

<p>(The following sections will probably not be covered in class, due
to time constraints, but feel free to bring questions.)

<p>GIF is popular, but it's not the only image format.  A big
limitation of GIF is that it can have a maximum of only 256 colors.
Images of real-world objects have thousands of subtle shades of
colors: reducing the number of colors to 256 would make them look
cartoon-like.

<p>For a real-world image, we would probably choose the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG">JPEG</a> image format.  JPEG
is a <em>lossy</em> compression technique.  The details are
complicated, but you can look at examples (say in the Wikipedia
article, above) and see that blocks of similar colors are replaced
with something like their average color.  This reduces the number of
colors, which is then compressed by a scheme somewhat like the
indexed-color idea.

<p>Another popular and important format is <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics">PNG</a>.

<h3>GIF versus JPEG versus PNG</h3>
         
<table>
<tr>
             <th> PNG </th>
             <th> GIF </th>
             <th> JPEG </th>
</tr>
<tr>
             <td align="center"> (27,639 bytes) </td>
             <td align="center"> w/ 2 colors (738 bytes) </td>
             <td align="center"> at 5% quality (918 bytes) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
             <td><img src="images/red-cross.png" alt="red cross in PNG format"></td>
             <td><img src="images/red-cross.gif" alt="red cross in GIF format"></td>
             <td><img src="images/red-cross.jpg" alt="red cross in JPG format"></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p> Consider the comparison above, in which the same simple image is
represented in three different formats.  The JPEG image looks bad, and yet
it's actually bigger than the GIF.  This example illustrates a situation
in which GIF does better than JPEG.  Of course, there are situations in
which JPEG does better than GIF.  Finally, although PNG is bigger than
either, it can be edited by Fireworks in vector mode, not bitmap mode,
which means that the red cross is an object you can manipulate, not just a
collection of bits.

<blockquote><p><strong>No one format is best</strong></blockquote>

<UL>

   <LI>GIF is limited to 256 colors, JPEG has millions, PNG has millions.
            
   <LI>GIF can compress images with few colors and large one-color areas
   very well, allows one-bit transparency, supports animation, and includes a
   proprietary (patented) compression algorithm.
            
   <LI>JPEG can compress photographs very well, typically much more than
   GIF. JPEG compression can be "tuned" (adjusted to trade quality for
   reduced file size).  JPEG does not allow transparency, and you cannot
   do animation in JPEG.  <!--Here is an excellent <a
   href="http://www.wellesley.edu/Chemistry/Flick/jpgquality.html">
   demonstration of JPEG quality/size tradeoff.</a-->
            
   <LI>PNG can compress "line-art" (cartoons and such) very well, since
   it's vector-based, allows 8-bit transparency, and includes an open-source,
   unpatented compression algorithm, but the generality of its
   representation means that PNG can often be a very big file.
   Furthermore, it is newer than the other formats, meaning that some
   older browsers don't support it.  Generally speaking, PNG files are
   converted to GIF or JPEG for putting on the web.
            
   <LI>Recent versions of the major browsers (IE, Chrome, Safari, and
   Firefox) support all three.
            
   <LI>If in doubt, generate all versions and compare sizes and quality.

   <li>Finally, never
   use BMP files.  BMP is an image file format used in Microsoft
   Windows, but it is <em>uncompressed</em> and therefore needlessly
   wastes bandwidth.  Always use a compressed format.

<h4>Another Occurrence of Hexadecimal</h4>
  
<p>You've gone to a lot of work to learn hexadecimal, when in many cases
  you can just look up the color you want, or use decimal in CSS.  Is
  there any other reason to have any familiarity with hexadecimal?  There
  are lots, but here's one that is quite practical:  URLs.

<p>We've told you that you can't use certain characters in a URL.  For
  example you can't use spaces, ampersands, slashes, question marks, and
  many others.  What if, for some reason, you really want to?  You're
  linking to something with a particular name, and you can't (or don't
  want to) rename it.  Here are some examples:

  <ul>
    <li><a href="hot%20head.html">hot head</a> has a space in it, and it
    would look weird as hothead.  
    <li><a href="hot+head.html">hot head</a> has a space in it, but we can
    use a + instead
    <li><a href="romeo%2bjuliet.html">romeo+juliet</a> has a plus in it,
    and the plus doesn't mean <q>space</q>
    <li><a href="the%20truth%20about%20cats%20%26%20dogs.html">the truth about cats
    &amp; dogs</a> is the name of a movie, and the movie's title uses an
    ampersand
    <li><a href="how%27s%20that%3f.html">how's that?</a> has an apostrophe
    and a question mark in it
  </ul>

<p>How does this all work?
  <ul>
    <li>A space is hex 20 in the ASCII table
    <li>A plus is hex 2B
    <li>An ampersand is hex 26
    <li>An apostrophe is hex 27
    <li>A question mark is hex 3F
  </ul>
