 <h1>Modularity Example!</h1> 

 <p>Ellen Hildreth came up with a very nice example of modularity, in
 which 6 functions can work together to help build two applications.
 I'll demonstrate the applications in class, and then we'll look behind
 the matrix at how the functions work.

 <p>You don't need to read over this before class; this is a purely
 in-class experience.  

   <p>Here are the applications:
     <ul>
       <li><a href="art.html">Application 1</a>
       <li><a href="play.html">Application 2</a>
     </ul>

   <p style="position: fixed; right: 5px; bottom: 5px"><a href="MI6.shtml">MI6</a>

<!--#set var="reltop" value="../.." -->
<!--#include virtual="../../navigation/footer.html" -->
</body>
</html>
