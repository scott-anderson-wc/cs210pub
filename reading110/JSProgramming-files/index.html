<!--[lyn, 3/8/09] Created this new document for introducing simple JavaScript 
    coding, with a focus on statements, expressions, and variables. 

    Some of this document is new, but it reuses and/or modifies many parts from 
    introJS/basic_JS_code.html and L05-dynamic/index.html. 

    Unlike previous lecture notes, this one does the following:

    (1) defines statements and the sequential execution of statements. 

    (2) gives lots of examples of expressions (including prompt) *before* introducing variables. 

    (3) Uses Execution Boxes for many of the examples. (Also, uses the name
        "Execution Box" rather than "Evaluation Box", because Execution Boxes
        contain statements to be executed and not expressions to be evaluated.)

    (4) Punts certain things until later lectures: 
        + swapping variables is delayed until next lecture. 
        + booleans are punted until boolean/conditional lecture. 

    (5) Motivates variables as a means of memory. 

Scott: Major changes.  Introduced the notion of a Gather/Compute/Report
        model of computation, with the Gather stage saving stuff in
        variables, so this version introduces variables earlier.  It uses
        a series of examples to generalize the notion of computing
        stuff. It puts off annoying details of things, such as the %
        operator, dealing with embedded quotation marks, breaking strings
        across line boundaries and nested comments.  It banishes all
        examples with heavy embedding, which we only did to put off the
        introduction of variables.

        I've removed mention of the % operator.  Let's punt that until
        Date object processing, when we can introduce it in the context of
        an example like "5 days from now" (which might wrap around a
        weekend).

  sohie  march2012  Fixed solutions to match the exercises in the document.

Scott (February 2013):  Added jQuery material.

Scott (September 2013): removed document.write; script tags at the end of 
    file, and do things as much as possible in a jQuery way.

    TODO: make the page template pretty
    regularize the execute boxes, so that they're easier to do and more uniform

Eni (February 2014): moved to new website. 
- I left out the Javascript applications lecture notes (need rewriting with new examples),
thus I put the first paragraph of those notes here.
- Cut down the number of examples from 7 to 4. These are sufficient for a first taste.
- Changes the section on Javascript scheleton, to make it analogue to CSS.
- Commented out the whole jQuery section, which will be introduced later in the semester.

          <h2 id="apps">Javascript Applications</h2>

<P>So far we've learned two languages: HTML and CSS.  Today, we start
learning the third of the three languages taught in CS110: JavaScript.
We will just begin talking about it, so don't worry if you don't
understand everything immediately.

<P>JavaScript is a programming language for making <em>dynamic</em> web
pages, i.e., pages that can interact with the user and vary each time they
are loaded. Although the names are similar, JavaScript is
<strong>not</strong> the same language as Java, which is the
programming language used in CS111 (until Spring 2014). 

<P>As part of your project you are required to write four distinct
JavaScript applications &mdash; each student must do two of the four.  The
four applications must all be different from each other and you will
be rewarded for the complexity of these applications. We will also
look at how well the applications are integrated into the site &mdash; do
they fit naturally or are they &ldquo;tacked on&rdquo;?

<P>During the upcoming design phase of the project (P2) you must clearly
indicate how you and your partner plan to fulfill this JavaScript
requirement.

<!-- Feb 2014: Eni commented this out, because is planning to change what
kind of applications can be used to fulfill the Javascript requirement.->>
<!--p>We'll start by looking at a number of examples to help you
understand what types of website features can be implemented using
JavaScript.  Since you haven't yet learned to write
JavaScript, we won't be looking at the code that created these
examples at first.  Rather, we will just explore what they are and how they
work.  These examples should be used as a guide and inspiration as you
think about those JavaScript features that you would like in your
final site.<!-->
 
<p>In the lectures to come, you will see plenty of examples of Javascript,
   that you can use to inspire you to choose applications for your
   website. <!--Our project documentation will also specify the level of 
   difficulty for the applications, to let you choose according to your
   skill level.</p--> You can see some examples of applications that 
  students have implemented for their projects in the <a href="/~cs110/project/gallery/">
  Hall of Fame</a>. The last assignment in the semester brings together many
  of the skills you will learn in the next weeks: generating content
  dynamically, keeping track of user choices, roll-over effects, jQuery user interface
  elements, filling and submitting forms. Here is a short 
  <a href="checkout_level3.mov">screencast of the completed assignment</a>.
          
<h2 id="simple">Simple Javascript Examples</h2>  
          
<p>We will begin our investigation of JavaScript by presenting a series of
  simple but working examples.  We'll show you the code, but you
  should <em>not</em> try to completely understand it at this point.
  Instead, you should read it, make some guesses as to what various things
  might mean, and try to get the gist of what is happening without
  worrying about all the details.  Later, after we have explained some of
  the notation and its meaning, we can go back to these examples and
  understand them more fully.

<p>(This is a little like trying to learn a foreign language by walking
  around the country, listening to the words people say and observing what
  they do.  You'll miss a lot, especially at first, but it's way more
  interesting than trying to start by reading a dictionary and memorizing
  vocabulary and syntax.)          
          
 <h3 id="hello">Example 1: Hello</h3>

<p>Here, we <em>gather</em> data in the form of the user's name, then we <em>compute</em> a
  response string by gluing their name onto the end of a common greeting,
  and finally <em>output</em> the result with a popup window.

<div>
<textarea rows=4 cols=80>
var name = prompt("What is your name?");
var response = "Hello, " + name;
alert(response);
</textarea><br>
<button onclick="eval(this.parentNode.firstElementChild.value);">Execute it</button>
</div>

<p>We would probably never do this greeting in a real website, but
  someone's name could be filled into a form, added to a roster, guest
  list or signup sheet, emailed to someone, ...  
  
  <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
      <h4>Experiment</h4>
    Delete the part <code>var name =</code> in the first line and execute the code again.
    What happens? Can you explain it? What roles are <code>name</code> and <code>response</code>
    playing?
  </div>

<h3 id="namelength">Example 2: Name Length</h3>

<p>This is almost the same, but we tell them the length of their name.


<div>
<textarea rows=5 cols=80>
var aName = prompt("What is your name?");
var len = aName.length;
var response = aName + ", your name has " + len + " letters.";
alert(response);
</textarea><br>
<button onclick="eval(this.parentNode.firstElementChild.value);">Execute It </button>
</div>


<p>Again, not useful in itself, but it's nice to know that we can find out
  the length of a string.  For example, we can limit the length of
  people's posts in an application like a Facebook wall.          
          
   <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
      <h4>Experiment</h4>
     <ol>
       <li>What is the result if you enter a full name, like <em>Harry Potter</em>. Is the
     length you get what you expected?</li>
       <li>Delete the part <code>var aName =</code> in the first line and execute the code again.
    Can you explain what happens this time? Open the Inspect Element and switch to the Console tab.
       Anything interesting there?</li>
     </ol>
    
     
  </div> 
          
<h3 id="weight">Example 3: Weight Conversion</h2>

<p>Here, we ask for a number and use it in a calculation.

<div>
<textarea rows=6 cols=80>
// You should enter a number (usually from 100 to 300).
var lbs = prompt("What is your weight in pounds (you may lie)?");
var kg = lbs / 2.2;
var response = "That weight in kilograms is " + kg + ".";
alert(response);
</textarea><br>
<button onclick="eval(this.parentNode.firstElementChild.value);">Execute It</button>        
</div>
          
   <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
      <h4>Experiment</h4>
      <p>You probably saw a very long number as an answer. For example, the
     result for 130, is 59.090909090909086. It would be nice to round it up. And you can.
     If you copy the <code>Math.round(59.090909090909086)</code> in the Inspect Element's Console,
        you'll see the result 59. Can you find a way to put <code>Math.round</code> in the code above, so that 
     it gives you a rounded value in the prompt window.</p>
  </div> 
          
<h3 id="quest">Example 4: Homage to Monty Python and the Holy Grail</h3>

<p>Here, we ask for the person's name, quest, and favorite color.  We then
  modify the box below, which was created with the following HTML and CSS:
  
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-5">
      <pre>
&lt;div id="grail"&gt;
  Your name here
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-5">
      <pre>
#grail {  
  border: 5px solid gray;
  color: gray;
  width: 50%;
}
</pre>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div id="grail">Your name here</div>
<div>
<textarea rows=9 cols=80>
var name = prompt("What is your name?", "Arthur, King of the Britons");
var quest = prompt("What is your quest?", "To seek the grail");
var color = prompt("What is your favorite color?", "blue");
var text = name + ": " + quest;
var box = document.querySelector("#grail");
box.innerHTML = text;
box.style.borderColor = color;
box.style.color = color;
</textarea><br>
<button onclick="eval(this.parentNode.firstElementChild.value);">Execute it</button>       
</div>

   <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
      <h4>Experiment</h4>
    Add at the bottom of the given code some other style property for the box.
     For example, try to set the padding to 10px or to set the value of the background color.
     If you don't see the desired effect, open Inspect Element and click on the Console
     tab. If there was an error in your code, it will show here in a message in red.
  </div> 
          
<h2 id="js2html">Javascript and HTML</h2>  
  <p>Javascript, just like CSS, is a different language from HTML. You might remember that
        HTML is responsible for defining the structure of a document, CSS for defining its
        appearance, and Javascript for defining the behavior of a page. Similarly to the way
          CSS interacts with HTML through <em>inline styles</em>, <em>document-level styles</em>
          and an <em>external stylesheet</em>, Javascript has the same three ways, but with a 
          different syntax.</p>
          
          <ol>
            <li><em>inline Javascript</em> - In this case, the Javascript code is given as a
            value to an attribute of the HTML element. An example is the way all the 
            <code>Execute it</code> buttons in the four examples above worked. Here is the code:</li>
            <pre>
&lt;button onclick=<strong>"eval(this.parentNode.firstElementChild.value);"></strong>Execute it&lt;/button&gt; 
</pre>
          <li><em>document-level Javascript</em> - In this case, the Javascript code will be 
          entered within the tag <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>. Differently from CSS, where
          the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag could be only included in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>
          part of the document, in Javascript you can put <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> either in
          the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> or anywhere inside the the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>.
          <strong>A usual practice</strong> is to put the code just before the closing tag for <code>body</code>. Here is an example:</li>
          <pre>
&lt;body&gt;
  ...
  &lt;p&gt;Mouse over this paragraph to see a cool effect.&lt;p&gt;
  ...
  &lt;script&gt;
    var p = document.querySelector("p");
    function hideMe() { this.style.visibility = "hidden";}
    function showMe() { this.style.visibility = "visible";}
    p.onmouseover = hideMe;
    p.onmouseout = showMe;
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</pre>
          
          <li><em>external Javascript</em> - This is the most common way to have Javascript
          communicate with HTML (it's also good for modularity and website maintenance). 
          The entire Javascript code is in a separate file and we simply refer to it through
          the <code>script</code> tag. Here is an example:</li>
          <pre>
  &lt;script src="myJScode.js"&gt; &lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
          </ol>
   
        <p>We'll be using all three ways in our examples, but for your project, you
        should strive to have all your code in external Javascript files.</p>

<h2 id="learn">Learning the Language</h2>

<p>In the following sections, we'll get a first look at various facets of
  the language.  There's more to say about all of these, but this brief
  tour will help you see how these different aspects of the language fit
  together.  After all, when you learn a natural language (e.g. French or
  Chinese), you don't try to learn all the verbs first, before tackling
  any of the nouns or adjectives.  

<h3 id="variables">Variables</h3>

<p>Variables are just named storage locations for a program.  We used them
  in the examples above to store stuff that we computed (such as weight in kg) 
  or stuff that came from the user (such as their name or height).  
  The technical name for <q>stuff</q> might be <q>data</q>
  or <q>values</q>.

<p>You can put a value into a variable, using an <em>assignment</em>
  statement, like these examples:

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-5">
<pre class="sh_javascript">
    var name = "Harry Potter";
    var lbs = 150;
</pre>
      </div>
</div>
<p>Note that this use of the equals sign is <em>very</em> different from
  how it is used in mathematics.  In math, the equals sign is an assertion
  that two things have the same value.  In computer science, the equals
  sign means <q>Put the value on the right into the storage location on
  the left</q>.  <!--(Yes, this is confusing.  Some programming languages use
  a different symbol, but most use the equals sign.)-->

<p>Because the equals sign doesn't mean equality, we often pronounce it
  differently.  Instead of saying <q>lbs equals 150</q>, we
  say <q>lbs <em>gets</em> 150,</q> short for <q>gets assigned the
  value</q>.

<p>After it has been assigned to, the value can be retrieved and used just
  by giving the name of the variable.  For example, the following two
  statements <em>retrieve</em> the values of <code>name</code>
  and <code>lbs</code>, perform an operation on them, and then <em>assign</em> the
  new values to two new variables
  called <code>len</code> and <code>kg</code>.

    <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-5">
<pre class="sh_javascript">
    var len = name.length;
    var kg = lbs*2.2;
</pre>
    </div>
</div>
        
   <p>We will return to the concept of variables in future lectures.</p>   
        
<h3 id="alert">The <code>alert()</code> Statement</h2>

<p>The first few examples accomplished the <em>reporting</em> of the
  response by use of the <code>alert()</code> function.  It looked like
  this:
  
    <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-5">
<pre class="sh_javascript">
      alert(response);
</pre>
    </div>
</div>

<p>This built-in function will pop up a window that displays whatever
  value is supplied to the <code>alert()</code> function by placing it in
  the parentheses.  In this case, it reported the value that was in the
  variable named <code>response</code>.  In later examples, we
  saw <code>alert()</code> with an expression inside the parentheses. This
  expression is evaluated and then <code>alert()</code> reports the
  result.

<p>Alerts are annoying in working code, but they are very useful when
  testing and developing code, because they stop the execution of the
  program until you acknowledge them:

<div style="margin-bottom:15px;">
<textarea rows=5 cols=80>
alert("This is alert 1");
alert("This is alert 2");
alert(42);
</textarea><br>
<button onclick="eval(this.parentNode.firstElementChild.value)">Execute It</button>       
</div>


<p> A statement like <code>alert("foo")</code> is an example of a
<strong>function call</strong> or <strong>function invocation</strong>,
where <code>alert</code> is the name of a standard JavaScript function and
the expression in parentheses (in this case, <code>"foo"</code>) is
the <strong>argument</strong> of (that is, <q>input to</q>) the function.

<h3 id="console_log">The <code>console.log()</code> Statement</h2>

<p>Very similar to <code>alert()</code> but much less annoying
is <code>console.log()</code>.  It's used in almost exactly the same way:
you put a value (or a variable containing a value) into the parentheses,
and that value gets reported.  However, the difference is
that <code>alert()</code> demands that the user acknowledge it,
while <code>console.log</code> writes it to a hidden place that only web
developers know about, and keeps going, so the user is not annoyed or
delayed by the message.

<p>The console is also where the browser writes error messages. <!--It writes
  them there so that the muggles won't see them and worry about them, but
  the wizards and witches of the web (such as yourselves) can easily see
  them.-->  As of this writing, here's how you can find them:
  <ul>      
    <li>Chrome: View &gt; Developer &gt; JavaScript Console.  Or, use the
    keyboard shortcut: option-command-j
      
    <li>Firefox: Tools &gt; Web Developer &gt; Error Console.  Or, use the 
      keyboard shortcut: command-shift-J on a Mac.
      
    <li>Safari: Develop &gt; Show Error Console.  Or, use the keyboard
    shortcut: option-command-C
  </ul>

<p>Try it!  Click the button below to execute those
  two <code>console.log</code> statements and then look for them in the
  console of your current browser.

<div style="margin-bottom:15px;">
<textarea rows=3 cols=80>
console.log("five plus three equals ...");
console.log(8);
</textarea><br>
<button onclick="eval(this.parentNode.firstElementChild.value)">Execute It</button>  

</div>


<p>We will use <code>console.log</code> and <code>alert</code> a lot as a
way of getting some insight into what our code is doing and to help
understand it and debug it.  So it's worth becoming comfortable with
finding and looking at the console.
  
  
<h3 id="comments">Comments</h2>
         
<p>You should always add comments to your JavaScript code to explain its purpose.
As shown in the example below, JavaScript supports two kinds of comments: 

<ol>

  <li> A <strong>block comment</strong> starting with <code style="color:red">/*</code>
       and ending with <code style="color:red">*/</code> that may span several lines. 
       (This is the same form as a CSS comment.)

  <li> A <strong>line comment</strong> that starts with <code style="color:red">//</code>
       and goes to the end of the line. 

</ol>

<pre>
 &lt;script&gt;
                  
    <span style="color: red">/* (Block Comment) Pop up an alert box with a
      message making sure that you
    all are awake because at this time of day, you might be sleepy. 
    Of course, a lot of it depends on what you were doing last night...  */</span>
    alert("Hey you there -- wake up!");

    <span style="color: red">// (Line Comment) The user must be awake if we reach this point!</span>
    console.log("User has woken up"); 

&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>In addition to explaining the code, we can use comments to 
to <q>comment out</q> a line of code that we don't want to run (sometimes when
  we are debugging to find where the error lies).

<h3 id="expressions">Values and Expressions</h2>

<p>JavaScript programs manipulate <strong>values</strong>. The two basic
kinds of values we've seen today are:

<ol>

<li><strong>Numbers</strong>: These include both integers (e.g. 17, -42)
and floating point numbers (e.g. 3.14159, -273.15). 

<li><strong>Strings</strong>: These are sequences of characters, 
which are written using matched pairs of 
the double quote character (<code>&quot;</code>) or
the single quote character (<code>'</code>): 

<pre class="sh_javascript">
"Harry Potter"
'grail'
</pre>

</ol>

<p>An <strong>expression</strong> is a JavaScript phrase that 
<strong>denotes a value</strong>. The simplest numeric expression
is a number itself. We can also create more complex numeric 
expressions using the numeric operators
<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>
and <code>%</code>:

   <table border=2 style="margin: 0px auto;">
    <tr>
     <th class="exp">Expression</th>
     <th class="val">Value</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td class="exp"><code>27</code></td>
     <td class="val"><code>27</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td class="exp"><code>27 + 10</code></td>
     <td class="val"><code>37</code></td>

<p>The % operator is the <em>remainder</em> or <em>modulus</em> operator.
  Its value is the <em>remainder</em> when the first number is divided by
  the second.  <!--We saw it in the example when converting centimeters to
  feet and inches.--> Here is an example of when it can be used.  
  An average size woman might be 64 inches tall. To find
  the number of feet, we divide 64 by 12 and round down, to get 5.  To get
  the number of leftover inches, we divide 64 by 12 and take the
  remainder, using the % operator.  That gives us the 4.  The remainder
  operator is more useful than you might think. But don't worry about it;
  you can think of it as a weird kind of division.

<h2 id="precedence">Precedence</h2>

<p>For the most part, JavaScript follows the
  algebraic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations">precedence
  rules</a> that you learned in school years ago.<!--, often with a mnemonic
  like <q>Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally</q> or <q>PEMDAS</q> or
  something.  That just says:-->
  <ul>
    <li>Parenthesized expressions
      
    <li>Exponents (we won't use these much)
      
    <li>Multiplication and Division (and Remainder)
        
    <li>Addition and Subtraction
      
  </ul>

<p>JavaScript follows these rules, so your prior experience will serve as
  a good guide.  There are a few new operators that you'll learn, such as
  the <code>%</code> or remainder operator, <!--also called
  the <em>modulus</em> operator,--> which has, unsurprisingly, the same
  precedence as division.

<p>Try to guess what the following will evaluate to:

<div style="margin-bottom:15px;">
<textarea name="code" rows=1>
alert( (1 + 5 % 2) );</textarea><br>
<input type=button value="Execute It" 
       onclick="eval(this.parentNode.firstElementChild.value)">
</div>

<!--h2 id="eval">Evaluating Expressions</h2>

<p>Expressions can be organized into trees of operations that can be
arbitrarily complex. For example, the expression denotes a tree of numeric
operations:
  <blockquote><p><code>((3 * 5) + (8 / 4)) - (9 % 2)</code> 
  </blockquote>

<p><img src="eval-tree.png" alt="evaluation tree for ((3 * 5) + (8 / 4)) - (9 % 2)">

<p>The process of determining the value of an expression is called 
<strong>evaluation</strong>.  Expressions are evaluated as you'd expect,
starting at the leaves of the tree and working left to right, combining
branches until only one value remains.  Here are the evaluation steps for
our example:

<pre>
   ((3 * 5) + (8 / 4)) - (9 % 2)
=> (  15    + (8 / 4)) - (9 % 2)
=> (  15    +    2   ) - (9 % 2)
=>         17          - (9 % 2)
=>         17          -    1
=>                     16
</pre>

<p>The arguments to functions and methods like <code>alert()</code> 
and <code>document.write()</code> can be arbitrary expressions. 
This provides an easy way to test expression evaluation:<br>

<form action="">
<div>
<textarea name="code" rows=1>
alert( ((3 * 5) + (8 / 4)) - (9 % 2) );</textarea><br>
<input type=button value="Execute It" 
       onclick="eval(this.parentNode.firstElementChild.value)">
</div>
</form-->

<h3 id="quote_marks">Strings and Quotation Marks</h2>

<p>Literal strings can be denoted by either single or double quotes, which
  gives you some flexibility about how to handle awkward situations such
  as quotation marks inside a string:

   <table border=2>
    <tr>
     <th class="exp">Expression</th>
     <th class="val">Value</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td class="exp"><code>"Let's play Tag!"</code></td>
     <td class="val"><code>Let's play Tag!</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td class="exp"><code>'Not "it"!'</code></td>
     <td class="val"><code>Not "it"!</code></td>
    </tr>
   </table>

<p>These examples show that you can put a single quote inside double
  quotes and a double quote inside single quotes.

<h3 id="concatenation">Concatenation of Strings</h3>

<p>The main operation on strings is the concatenation
operator, <code>+</code>:

   <table border=2>
    <tr>
     <th class="exp">Expression</th>
     <th class="val">Value</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td class="exp"><code>"CS" + "110" + " rocks!"</code></td>
     <td class="val"><code>CS110 rocks!</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="exp"><code>"Harry" + "Cho"</code></td>
      <td class="val"><code>HarryCho</code></td>
    </tr>
   </table> 

<p>We saw this many times in the examples, as we created our response text
  out of literal strings, values supplied by the user, and computations
  from them.

<h3 id="parseInt">The <code>parseInt()</code> and <code>parseFloat()</code> Functions</h2>

<p>We'll see that there are many situations where it's necessary to
convert from a string of digits to numbers. The
  <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_parseint.asp"><code>parseInt()</code></a>
and
  <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_parsefloat.asp"><code>parseFloat()</code></a>
  functions are used for this purpose. The first one is used with integer numbers
  and the second one with decimal numbers.<!--We saw that in the examples when
  we prompted the user for a number that we wanted to compute with.-->

  <table border=2>
    <tr>
     <th class="exp">Expression</th>
     <th class="val">Value</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td class="exp"><code>parseInt("243")</code></td>
     <td class="val"><code>243</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td class="exp"><code>parseInt("cs110",10)</code></td>
     <td class="val"><code>NaN <I>(Not a Number)</i></code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td class="exp"><code>parseFloat("3.141")</code></td>
     <td class="val"><code>3.141</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td class="exp"><code>parseInt("3.141")</code></td>
     <td class="val"><code>3</code></td>
    </tr>
   </table>

<!--p>The second argument to <code>parseInt</code> is the <em>radix</em>
  or <code>base</code> that you want to use.  It can be 10 for decimal
  number, 16 for hexadecimal numbers and 8 for octal numbers (base 8).
  It's a good idea to supply this value, to avoid JavaScript inadvertently
  doing the wrong thing.-->

<p>You can test any of the above expressions here:<br>


<div style="margin-bottom:15px;">
<textarea name="code" rows=2 cols=80>
alert( parseInt("2.718") );
</textarea><br>
<button onclick="eval(this.parentNode.firstElementChild.value);">Execute it</button>
</div>


<h3 id="prompt"><a href="#prompt">The <code>prompt()</code> Function</a></h2>

<p>Like <code>alert()</code>, invoking the <code>prompt()</code> function
pops up a small window, but (1) it also allows the user to type in a
string and (2) the string entered by the user is returned as the value of
invoking the <code>prompt()</code> function.

<p><!--em>Warning: The <code>prompt()</code> function does not work properly
in certain browsers, especially some versions of Internet Explorer. So
it's best not to use it in projects. We will use forms instead, which are
much better.  However, <code>prompt()</code> is helpful for teaching
certain aspects of JavaScript in an interactive setting, so we will use it
in class for examples.</em-->
 
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>The <code>prompt()</code> method is not a good use of Javascript and you will
          not use it in your projects. Instead we will either use HTML forms,
          or the jQuery library.</p>
</div>
          
<p>For example, the following statement prompts the user
for a first name and then stores it in a variable.

<div style="margin-bottom:15px;">
<textarea rows=2 cols=80>
var first_name = prompt("What's your first name?");
console.log(first_name);
</textarea><br>
<button onclick="eval(this.parentNode.firstElementChild.value);">Execute it</button>
</div>


<p>The result of invoking the <code>prompt()</code> function is always a
string, <strong>NOT</strong> a number, even if it's all digits, so it's necessary
to use
<code>parseInt()</code> or <code>parseFloat()</code> to convert sequences
of digits entered by the user to numbers.  Compare the following two
examples:

<div style="margin-bottom:15px;">
<textarea rows=5 cols=80>
var a = prompt("Enter a decimal number");
var b = prompt("Enter an integer number");
var result = a + b;
alert("The result is " + result);
</textarea><br>
<button onclick="eval(this.parentNode.firstElementChild.value);">Execute it</button>
</div>


<p>In this example, we convert the strings into numbers, then add the
  numbers and report the result.


<div style="margin-bottom:15px;">
<textarea rows=7 cols=80>
var a = prompt("Enter a decimal number");
var b = prompt("Enter an integer number");
var x = parseFloat(a);
var y = parseInt(b);
var result = x + y;
alert("The result is " + result);
</textarea><br>
<button onclick="eval(this.parentNode.firstElementChild.value);">Execute it</button>
</div>


<p>Note that if we never need the strings <code>a</code>
  and <code>b</code>, we can take the value of <code>prompt</code> and
  immediately convert it to a number using <code>parseInt</code>:

<div style="margin-bottom:15px;">
<textarea rows=5 cols=80>
var x = parseFloat(prompt("Enter a decimal number"));
var y = parseInt(prompt("Enter an integer number"));
var result = x + y;
alert("The result is " + result);
</textarea><br>
<button onclick="eval(this.parentNode.firstElementChild.value);">Execute it</button>
</div>
</form>

<h3>Default values</h3>

<p>The first argument of the <code>prompt()</code> function is displayed
above the input area of the prompt box. 
The <code>prompt()</code> function takes an <em>optional</em> second argument
that, if supplied, is used as a default value for the input area. 
For example: 

<div style="margin-bottom:15px;">
<textarea rows=3 cols=80>
var school = prompt("What is your school?", "Wellesley");
alert("Oh, you go to "+school+". How nice.");
</textarea><br>
<button onclick="eval(this.parentNode.firstElementChild.value);">Execute it</button>
</div>
</form>

<p>Using a default value makes it easier on the user when the default is
right, but allows him or her to correct (override) the value when it's wrong.
