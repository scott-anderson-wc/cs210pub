        Reading: We strongly suggest you read chapter 7
        of <em><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596159924.do">Head
        First HTML and CSS</a></em> with these notes.
      </div>
        
          <p>When HTML was first introduced, there were a number of tags whose
            purpose was just for formatting: for example, tags that center or switch
            to an italic font.  With HTML version 4.0, such tags were made obsolete
            (though most browsers still support them), in favor of a formatting
            technique called <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em>.</p>
          
          <h2 id="customizing">Customizing Your Tags</h2>

          <p>When a browser is displaying a page, there is a step of reading a
          tag, such as <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and
          then determining what the results are to look like.  (This is
          sometimes called <em>rendering</em> a page.)  Each browser has a default
          way of rendering a tag.  For example, most browsers will render the
          <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag by switching to an italic version of the current
          font.  Most browsers will render an <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag by switching
          to a very large version of the current font.  There are several important points
          to make about this:</p>
          
          <ul>
          
           <li>Different browsers don't necessarily render a tag the same way.
           For example, you might find that <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> in Safari
           indents by a different amount than Internet Explorer does.
          
           </li><li>Some control is transferred to the user.  A user can decide, via their
           browser <em>preferences</em>, what font families and font sizes they want
           to use, or what colors their links should be.  This is a good thing.
          
           </li><li>As the author of a web page, you can customize the rendering or
           <em>style</em> of tags in your pages.  For example, if you want the
           <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag to look red, you can do that.  The style of tags
           is determined by something called <em>CSS</em>, for Cascading Style
           Sheets.
          
          </li></ul>
            
          <h2 id="sheets">CSS Style Sheets</h2>
         
          <p>You can specify the style of a tag using a <em>style sheet</em>.  These
          style sheets can be put in (at least) three different places:
    
          </p>
          
          <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
          <ol>
          <li><em>Inline Styles.</em>  These are specified in the tag itself.
      
          </li><li><em>Document-Level (Internal) Style Sheets.</em> These are 
          specified in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of a document, using the special 
          tag <code>&lt;style&gt;</code>.
      
          </li><li><em>External Style Sheets.</em> These are specified in a
          separate CSS file that is connected to the HTML file by the
          <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag.  We discussed this link in the
            <a href="HTML.html#link">HTML reading</a>.
          </li></ol>
          </div>
          
          <p>Suppose that we always want <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> to be red
            in addition to being in italics.  (Be aware
            of <a href="#accessibility">accessibility</a>.)</p>
         
          <ol>

          <li><em>Inline Style.</em> You use the <code>style</code>
          <em>attribute</em> of the tag to set the <code>color</code>
          property to have the <em>value</em> red and the
          <code>background-color</code> property to have the <em>value</em> white.
          (You should be reminded of the attribute/value idea in tags, but
          the syntax is different.  With CSS, property/value pairs are
          separated by semi-colons, and the property ends with a colon.)
          Note that you should always <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/color">pick both colors</a>, in
          case the user's browser has specified a background color that
          matches your foreground color.  Here's the example:

<pre><code class="html">
this is an <code class="html"><span class="nt">&lt;em</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">&quot;color: red; background-color: white&quot;</span>&gt;important<span class="nt">&lt;/em&gt;</span></code> word
</code></pre>

    which results in:<br>

    <blockquote>
      <p>this is an <em style="background-color: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%; color: red;">important</em> word
    </p></blockquote>
            
            
    <li><em>Document-Level (Internal) Style Sheets.</em> You use the
    <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> <em>tag</em> in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of your
    document to specify the style for the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag once and
    for all:

<pre><code class="css">&lt;style&gt;
   em { 
      color: red; 
      background-color: white;
   }
&lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>

    <p>In your document (that is, in the tags enclosed by &lt;<code>body&gt;</code>), 
      you just use the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag normally, and it will be rendered as red.
    </p>
  </li>
            
  <li><em>External Style Sheets.</em> These look just like
    document-level style sheets, except that you don't put the
    definition(s) inside a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag.  Instead, you
    reference the file using the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag in the
    <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, the same place you would use the
    <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag.  Suppose we create a file called
    <code>my-style.css</code> that contains the following:

<pre><code class="css">em { 
   color: red; 
   background: white;
}</code></pre>

    <p>and we reference it in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> like this:

</p><pre><code class="html">&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="my-style.css"&gt;</code></pre>

    <p>As with document-level style sheets, we can just use the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag
    normally from then on.

    </p></li></ol>
          
          <h2 id="syntax">Syntax of a CSS Rule</h2>
          <p>Your <em>Head First HTML and CSS</em> book has a good graphic for explaining the
          syntax of a CSS rule:</p>
          
          <figure class="text-center">
            <img class="img-thumbnail" src="CSS1-files/CSS-rule-syntax.png" alt="explanation of a CSS rule">
            <figcaption>Explaining the syntax rule. Appears in pg. 259 of your book.</figcaption>          
          </figure>

      <p>There are several facets to the syntax of a CSS rule:
      
      </p><ul>
            
          <li>The style <em>properties</em> (such as <code>color</code>) are followed by
          a colon, then at least one space, then the value of the property (such
          as <code>red</code>).  <!--The only properties we've learned so far
          are <code>color</code> and <code>background</code> (which is a
          shorthand for <code>background-color</code>), but we'll learn more
          soon.  The discussion of fonts will cover font properties such
          as <code>weight</code> and <code>size</code>, for example.-->  If you
          want to specify more than one property/value pair, separate them with
          semi-colons.  If there's only one property/value pair, the semi-colon
          is optional.  (Many people put it in just in case they add another
          property/value pair later.) The order of the style properties does
          not matter.
      
          </li><li>For an in-line style, simply state the style properties as the
          value of the <code>style</code> attribute in the HTML tag. Remember to enclose
          the style properties within quotation marks.
      
          </li><li>For either a document-level style sheet or an external style
          sheet, the name of the element (such as <code>p</code> or
          <code>em</code>) that you are modifying goes first, then an
          opening brace, then the style properties, then a closing brace.
          In a CSS rule, the element to which we apply the style is known as the 
          <em><strong>selector</strong></em>. All tags can be selectors. However,
          we will see more ways to define selectors in the forthcoming material.
          Spaces and line breaks are ignored, so feel free to format this in
          a visually pleasing way.  As always, clear and consistent
          indentation is very helpful for any reader of your styles.
      
          </li><li>Document-level style sheets require the enclosing
          <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag, while external style sheets always omit
          the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag.
          
          </li><li>External style sheets and document-level style sheets use the
          same syntax for specifying the tags, properties and values, but the
          external style sheet <em>omits</em> the beginning and ending
          <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags.  <strong>You'll have nothing in angle 
          brackets in an external CSS file.</strong>
      
          </li><li>CSS is a different language from HTML and therefore has a
          different comment syntax in both an internal and external style
          sheet.  For CSS, the comment characters are <code>/*</code> to
          begin and <code>*/</code> to end.  Thus, for an external style
          sheet, you might have:
      
      <pre><code class="css">
/* Written by the CS210 Faculty
   Decided on 7/19/2016 to make EM magenta
*/
      
em {
   color: magenta; 
   background-color: white;
} </code></pre>    
  
      </li></ul>
          
          <h2 id="moreproperties">Some CSS Properties</h2>
          <p>Now that you know how to write style sheets, let us see some properties that 
          you can use in these styles. One can style an element over many aspects: 
            <ul>
            <li>color of the text
            <li>background of element (color, image, origin, position, etc.),
            <li>the border that surrounds the element (its color, size, style, etc.), 
            <li>the box that surrounds the element (margin, padding, size, etc.) 
            <li>the text inside the element (alignment, spacing, direction, etc.)</li> 
            <li>the font for the text of the element (font family, style, weight, etc.)</li>
          </ul>
        
          and other aspects that sometime are specific to certain elements such as tables, lists,
          user interface elements, etc. We suggest that you refer to the 
          <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp">CSS Reference website</a>
          for a listing and examples of all CSS properties.
          
          <h2>Examples</h2>
          
          <div class="alert alert-warning">

          <p>In the following, we give several examples of properties that
              are very useful for styling elements. For pedagogical
              purposes, we're not providing the code as text that can be
              easily copied and pasted somewhere else. We believe that by
              typing the instructions on your own, you will learn the
              names and values of properties, as well as potential errors
              that occur when one types. We strongly suggest that you
              use <a target="_blank"
              href="http://jsfiddle.net">jsfiddle</a> to try out all these
              examples. Before entering the code, read our questions and
              try to predict the answer without running the code. Then
              check if you were right.  To use jsfiddle, enter the HTML
              code in the HTML box, the CSS code in the CSS box, and then
              click the button Run. There is no need to write a whole HTML
              file, only the snippets shown in the examples. Also, to see
              the effect of styling, the text in HTML elements doesn't
              have to be meaningful as in our examples.</p>
          </div>
          
          <h3>Example 1</h3>

          <figure>
            <img class="img-thumbnail"
                 src="CSS1-files/example1_opacity.png"
                 alt="example for color and opacity">
            <figcaption>Using color and opacity.</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <h3>Questions for Example 1</h3>

          <p>In the rendered result, is the background color blue? Why
            not? What about the color of the text nested
            in <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>? Why it is not white like the rest?
            What does this tell about the order in which rules are
            applied?</p>
        <hr>

        <h3>Example 2</h3>  
        <figure>
            <img class="img-thumbnail" src="CSS1-files/example2_text.png" alt="example for text and list properties">
            <figcaption>Styling for text and lists.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <h3>Questions for Example 2</h3>
        <p>Try first to predict how this code will be rendered. What is the effect of each rule on every element?
          How will the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> nested in <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> look like? Then, enter this
          code in <em>jsfiddle</em> to see whether you were right in your predictions.</p>
          <hr>
          
<div style="display: none">
          <h3>Example 3</h3>
          <figure>
            <img class="img-thumbnail" src="CSS1-files/example3_background.png" alt="example for background and border">
            <figcaption>Styling for background, border, and text.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>The URL for the background image was generated with the <a href="http://goo.gl/">Google URL shortener service.</a></p>
        <h3>Questions for Example 3</h3>

          <p>What do you see when this code is rendered? What happens when
          you comment out the rule for
          <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>? Can you add styling for
          the <code>border-bottom</code> property?  What happens when you
          replace <code>border-top-</code> with <code>border-</code>
          (keeping the rest unchanged)?  What happens when you change the
          value for <code>text-align</code> from center to right? Finally,
          add this style <code>border: 3px solid red;</code>
          to <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> and see what happens. This is an
          example of combining values for several properties in one
          style.</p>
</div>
            
          <h2 id="cascading">Cascading</h2>

            <p>CSS has <q>cascading</q> in the title because there's a
            strict hierarchy that determines which specification applies
            if the style of a particular tag is set in more than one
            place.  Suppose you specified the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag
            as (1) green in an external style sheet, (2) blue in a
            document-level style sheet and (3) red in an inline style.
            Which wins?</p>
            
            <p>The simple answer is that the <em>closest</em> specification wins.
            This makes sense, because you can use the more local specifications
            to <em>override</em> the more distant, global specifications.  So, inline
            style attributes beat document-level sheets, and document-level sheets
            beat external style sheets.
            
            <p>Furthermore, properties from enclosing elements can be inherited by the
              elements inside them.  Notice how, in one of the examples,
              the <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> element inside
              the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element inherits its properties.
            
            <p>If you'd like all the technical details of the cascade, you
            can check the specifications
            of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1/#the-cascade">cascade
            order</a>
            <p>The process of resolving all the conflicting CSS rules is
            called the <em>cascade</em>.  The <em>Head First HTML and
            CSS</em> book has a detailed description for cascades on pages
            457-465. That description is pretty intimidating, though. In
            practice, the rules are pretty intuitive: the rule that is
            closer and more specific wins.
            
            <h2>Which Style Sheet to Use?</h2>
            
            <p>One of the most common rules of thumb for creating clear and
            beautiful documents is <em>consistency</em>.  For example, section
            headers should always be the same size, weight and font.
            
            </p><p>You can best achieve consistency by specifying the style far
            enough from the text so that the style is specified in just one place.
            If you have a single web page that you would like to be consistent, you
            should use a document-level style sheet. If you have several web pages
            (a web <em>site</em>) that you want to be consistent, you should
            definitely use an external style sheet.  Even if your website is only
            a single web page but you think you might someday have a second web
            page using the same style, you should use an external style sheet. In
            short, always use an external style sheet.
            
            </p><p>In this course, you and a partner will be creating a website
            for a client.  For that website, you should define an external style
            sheet.  Then, if you or your client decides that <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>
            should be centered, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> should be bold and blue,
            <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> should be underlined and non-bold, and <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>
            should be pink, you can do that in one place.  If you later change
            your mind and decide that <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> should be purple, you make
            one change in one file and all of your website is consistently and
            instantly changed.  If you had used the local style technique, you
            would have to edit every page of your site, searching for and
            modifying each occurrence.  This is tedious and error prone.

<h2 id="caches">Caches</h2>

<p>One of the great advantages of external style sheets is also, for a web
  developer, a slight bother.  To understand that, you have to understand
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)"><em>caches</em></a>.

<p>The
word <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cache">&ldquo;cache&rdquo;</a>
(pronounced &ldquo;cash&rdquo;) is an ordinary, but uncommon, English word
(more of an SAT word for most people).  However, it's used all the time by
computer scientists because caches are used all the time by computers, in
all kinds of ways, because caching is a general technique for <em>speeding
things up</em>.

<p>In particular, your web browser will <em>cache</em> (keep a copy of) an
  external style sheet in a folder on your local machine (that folder is
  called, of course, the <em>cache</em>).  If the web browser needs that
  style file again, say on another page of your site that uses the same
  external style file, the browser doesn't have to re-download the file;
  it just grabs a copy from the cache. This makes the web browser faster.

<p>So, why is the browser cache a problem for a web designer?  Because if
  you make a change to the external style sheet, the web browser may
  continue to use the old cached copy, instead of getting the new improved
  copy from the server.  This means that when you view your page, you
  won't see your changes &mdash; very frustrating.

<p>The solution is to tell the web browser to ignore the cache when you
  re-load the page.  In most web browsers, this is done by holding down
  the shift key when you click on the <em>reload</em> icon.

<p>So, just remember:
  <blockquote><p><strong>When in doubt, use shift+reload</strong></blockquote>


           <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
            
            <p>The idea of CSS illustrates an important concept in the field of
            computer science, namely <em>abstraction</em>.  Abstraction is the
            idea of saying what you want done without saying how to do it.  By
            leaving out the details about how to do something, you allow for some
            flexibility, so that you can revise your method of doing the task
            without messing up anything that depends on that task being
            done. Here, we said <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> without saying what that meant,
            putting elsewhere the specification of how to emphasize.</p>
          
                  
          <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger">
            <h2 id="accessibility">Footnote: Colors and Accessibility</h2>
            <p> Since 
            <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> stands for emphasis, what could be better emphasis
            than putting something in red? Unfortunately, using color to convey meaning is, in fact, a
            <em>terrible</em> idea, because some people are color-blind or even
            completely blind.  Fortunately, we are (1) still using the EM
            tag, so screen-reading software will know to emphasize this
            text, and (2) still using the default italic font-style, so
            color-blind readers will still have a visual cue. 

            <p>We'll talk more about the issue of <a
            href="http://webaim.org/intro">accessibility</a> as the need arises
            throughout this course.  You should <em>always</em> think about
            accessibility when you are designing a web page, because you want your
            page to be readable by anyone, not only by people with the same
            physical abilities, browser software, computer display, and network
            bandwidth that you have.  Some websites are <a
            href="http://webaim.org/intro#standards">legally required</a> to be
            accessible. However, for the purposes of this lecture's examples,
            let's suppose that using red is a sensible thing to do.</p>

            <p>Note also that red text printed to a black-and-white
            printer comes out light gray, which <em>de-</em>emphasizes
            it. To address that, we could use a media query and have a
            special CSS rule for printing EM elements. We'll learn about
            media queries later.
