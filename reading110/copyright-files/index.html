<h2 id="intellectual-property">Intellectual Property</h2>

<p>The results of intellectual work are covered by three distinctly
  different legal areas:
<UL>
<LI>Copyright
<LI>Trademarks
<LI>Patents
</UL>
<p>(A rant by Richard Stallman on the very
term <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html">intellectual
property</a> is worth reading.)

<p>A <strong>trademark is</strong> the recognizable mark that a
company has made to market its products.  It is not only the name of
the product that is covered by the trademark (e.g., Coca Cola), but
also the shape (e.g., the recognizable Coca Cola bottle shape, or the
font of the Coca Cola name used on the product).  This means that one
cannot create, say, LTCola and have it bottled in a Coca Cola-shaped
bottle or have its name written with a Coca Cola-looking type of font.
All famous marks are registered and watched by webcrawlers.  Domain
names that confuse origin or &ldquo;dilute the value of the
mark&rdquo; will be challenged by the owners (even in ridiculous cases
such as the &ldquo;Christmas Blend&rdquo; of Starbucks.)

<p>
The work of an inventor is covered by a <strong>patent.</strong> A
patent is issued after careful review by the patent office, which
must be persuaded that the work described in the patent is not a
trivial extension of an existing work (&ldquo;prior art&rdquo;).

<p>
In your project, it is not likely that you will produce or infringe
upon a patent.  You might violate a trademark if, for example, you
decide to have the picture of a a Coca Cola bottle on your page or you
use the same font, color, and style to write something.  What you need
to pay particular attention, though, is on the Copyright Law.

<h2 id="copyright">Copyright law</h2>

<p><strong>Copyright</strong> is about the <b>rights</b> of the
author, artist, or creator.

<P>What rights does an author have?  Suppose you're the author of a
novel.  You can:
<ol>

    <li><strong>Reproduce copies of the work.</strong> In other words, you
    can print up 100,000 copies of your novel to sell, but no one else
    can.

    <li><strong>Prepare derivative works.</strong> You can write a sequel
    to your novel, a different version (maybe with a different ending) and
    so forth, but no one else can.

    <li><strong>Distribute copies.</strong> You can sell or give away the
    copies that you made, but if you decide to keep them all in your
    attic, no one else can give them away for you.

    <li><strong>Publicly perform it.</strong> Suppose instead of a novel,
    you've written a play.  You can decide who can and cannot perform your
    play.

    <li><strong>Publicly display it.</strong> Suppose instead of a novel,
    you've painted a painting: you can control whether it is displayed in
    a gallery or stays under your bed.

</ol>

<p>Of course, as the owner of the copyright, you can decide to sell or
lease the rights, piecemeal or in total, to other people.  Musicians
often sell their rights to the record company.  Sometimes in the fine
print at the end of a movie, you'll see &ldquo;for the purposes of
copyright, the owner of this film is Paramount Pictures, Inc.&rdquo;

<p>Note that copyright applies to <em>things,</em> in the sense that your
creative endeavor has to be fixed in some medium: paper, videotape or
whatever.  You can't copyright an idea; that idea has to be expressed
somehow.

<h2 id="copyright-purpose">Purpose of Copyright</h2>

<p>Copyright law didn't always exist.  Copyright actually began in England
in 1557.  It was a royal decree that allowed only designated printers to
publish.  That way the government controlled what was printed (censorship)
and at the same time protected the market for the designated printers.
With the end of censorship, the notion of copyright evolved into the
Statute of Anne (1710), which is considered to be the forerunner of modern
copyright.  The full title of the law says,

<blockquote> 
<p>An act for the encouragement of learning, by vesting the copies
of printed books in the authors or purchasers of such copies, during
the times therein mentioned.
</blockquote>

<p>Copyright was not granted primarily for the benefit of authors, but so
that authors would have an incentive to create works, thereby benefitting
society.  Of course, now the record and movie industries have powerful
lobbies in Washington, so copyright law is being extended to benefit these
big corporations.  They are also jealously protecting their copyrights.

<p>Copyrights don't last forever.  For a long time, the law was that
copyright protection ended 70 years after the author's death. It's
actually more complicated than that, depending on whether the author
is anonymous or whether a corporation now owns the copyright (see
the resources section, below).

<p>The movie industry got the copyright law extended so that the movies
that were released in the 1920s, where the copyright was about to expire,
are still copyrighted. Now the copyright is held by the employer for 95
years since publication or 125(!) years from creation.

<h2 id="public-domain">Public Domain</h2>

<p>When a work is no longer copyrighted, it is in <strong> the public
domain </strong> and therefore is owned by society in general.  This is
where society really benefits from the new works created by copyright law.
Once something is in the public domain, the author no longer has any
rights and anyone can do with it what they want.  For example, someone
wrote <em> West Side Story </em> without having to pay any royalties to
Shakespeare's estate, because <em> Romeo and Juliet </em> is now in the
public domain.  Similarly, anyone can perform the works of J. S. Bach,
because he's been dead for more than 70 years.

<p>Note, though, that a <em> performance </em> of a work is copyrighted.
So, if the Wellesley Widows perform a 17th century art song, they own the
copyright to their performance, even though the song is in the public
domain.

<p>In fact, some authors will create things and explicitly place them in
the public domain, giving up their rights so that others can immediately
make derivative works, building on the contribution.

<h2 id="copyrighting-something">Copyrighting Something</h2>

<p>What is copyrightable? An original work of intellectual authorship.
This has a rather low threshold (many things can fall into this category).
But facts, ideas, titles, short phrases, and public domain information are
<strong>not</strong> copyrightable.

<p>How do you copyright something?  Do you have to write the &copy; symbol
on the work and register it with some office somewhere?  No, the 1971
Berne convention, an international convention of most countries in the
world, declared that any work of yours is automatically copyrighted unless
you explicitly place it in the public domain.  (The U.S. joined the Berne
convention in 1989.)  If you made it; you control it.  This holds whether
or not a copyright notice is attached and whether or not the work is
registered.  Of course, adding those steps indicates that you intend to
protect your rights, so it's not a bad idea.

<h2 id="fair-use">Rules for Fair Use</h2>

<p>The author doesn't hold complete power over of her work.  There is an
important legal concept of <em>fair use</em>, so that society can gain
some benefits immediately.  Examples:

<ul>

    <li>A critic can quote passages from a novel or show clips from a
    movie to illustrate the ideas in the review.

    <li>A teacher can use sections from a book for educational reasons.

</ul>

<p>How can you know whether something is &ldquo;fair use&rdquo;?
There is no easy answer.  The only real answer can be found in a
court, but we can say what the court's decision will be based on [from
<a href="http://www.wellesley.edu/Library/copyright.html">
http://www.wellesley.edu/Library/copyright.html </a>] the following 4
criteria:

<ol>

    <li>The <strong>purpose and character</strong> of the use.  Non-profit
    and educational use is in your favor, but won't necessarily win the
    case for you.  All the criteria are taken into account.

    <li>The <strong>nature</strong> of the copyrighted work, with special
    consideration given to the distinction between creative work and
    informational work.  For example, you're on safer ground copying a
    news story than a purely creative or literary work.

    <li>The <strong>amount, substantiality, or portion</strong> of the
    work.  Copying a few lines from a novel is a small part, while copying
    one chapter from a three-chapter book is pretty big.  Copying as
    little as you can will work in your favor.  On the other hand, keep in
    mind that not all parts are created equally.  Taking just the right
    snippet from a pop song might be crucial, because that snippet is the
    key to the song.

    <li>The effect of the use on the <strong> potential market
    </strong> of the copyrighted work.  This factor is the key factor
    from which the others are derived.  If your use significantly
    reduces the potential revenues an author gets from the work, the
    court may rule against you.  People sometimes forget this when
    they say &ldquo;but I'm not making any money!&rdquo; In fact, no
    one really cares whether you're making any money.  The author
    cares about whether your use is depriving her of money.  If you
    use your CD burner to give away free copies of Britney Spears's
    latest oeuvre, you're depriving her of sales, even though you
    don't make a dime.

</ol>

<p> An important related point is that copyright is different from
plagiarism.  Most of us know that we have to quote properly in our
research papers and give credit where credit is due.  If I quote from your
research paper, I have to give you credit.  However, if I've quoted so
much of your work (chapters and chapters) that I get into trouble with
copyright, giving you credit isn't going to help.  After all, the bootleg
CD of Britney Spears isn't passing itself off as someone else's work;
that wouldn't be the point.

<h2 id="implications">Implications for your Web Site</h2>

<p>What does copyright law mean for you and your web site?  It means that
you should assume anything you find on the internet is copyrighted and
that you may not use it without permission of the author.  Certain things
are intended to be copied, and the author may well explicitly grant
permission for that.  For example, snippets of code at a JavaScript
download site are obviously intended to be used in your web page.  You
should do so with a clear conscience.  Academic honesty requires that you 
give credit to the web site, but that has nothing to do with copyright.

<p> For the purposes of your homework or project in this class, not giving
credit might constitute plagiarism.  Ask your instructor if you are not sure.

<p>Similarly, when you are putting things on the site, you may need to
think about copyright.  Say there's a cartoon you'd like to put on it.  It
might be a cartoon that your client (a professor) always uses in lecture.
Is this fair use?  Look back at the criteria, and you see that (1) the
class may be educational, but the primary purpose of the cartoon is
probably just to be amusing; (2) the work is probably highly creative; (3)
you've used the entire cartoon; and (4) the cartoonist sells this for
money, and if it's free, globally, on the internet, there goes the market.
A court would probably rule that this is not fair use.  (On the other
hand, cartoons are ephemeral, the cartoonist makes a new cartoon every
day, so one cartoon might not dent the sales of the latest Dilbert
compendium.)  It also depends on the artist/cartoonist.  Bill Watterson
and his syndicate has zealously protected <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i> for
many years.  Scott Adams probably protects <i>Dilbert</i> just as
fiercely, but might not.

<p> One thing to keep in mind is that the internet is <em> global </em>.
Thus, the market effect of putting something on the web is a zillion times
greater than just using it in a campus course.  (Thirty students versus a
billion on the web.)  One approach to this is to restrict access to
copyrighted material, say via a password or something.

<h2 id="drm">Digital Rights Management</h2>

<p>Copying digital information is extremely easy. This encourages people
to freely share digital music, videos, books, software, etc., even though
such sharing may violate copyright laws. 

<p>Digital Rights Management (DRM) refers to technological and legal methods of 
protecting the copyright of digital information. On the technology side, 
digital information may be associated with "copy protection" or
"content protection" systems that try to prevent the information from 
being copied. For example, some distributors of digital music use a combination 
of DRM information in music files and DRM software in the music players 
to limit the number of times the music file can be copied or played
or the duration of time in which it can be played. 
Software available for trial download uses DRM to ensure that the 
software can't be used after the trial period expires. 
DVD video discs use a Content Scramble System (CSS) to encrypt the 
contents of the discs as an attempt to prevent the discs from being
copied or being played by devices not licensed by the DVD Copy Control
Association. 

<p>Software-only approaches to DRM can be circumvented by skilled technologists,
who often publish descriptions of how to circumvent the DRM or 
applications that circumvent the DRM. In response, the computer industry has developed 
hardware-assisted approaches to <i>Trusted Computing</i>, whose goal is to prevent
uncertified programs from manipulating copyrighted digital information. 
A popular incarnation of this idea is the <i>Trusted Platform Module (TPM)</i>,
a chip that uses cryptography to verify that the operating system and 
applications manipulating the DRM-protected digital information have not been 
compromised. 
This chip is also known as the "Fritz chip" after former
Senator Ernest "Fritz" Hollings, who championed its adoption. 
Many computers sold today are equipped with a Fritz chip.

<p>Because many forms of digital information must ultimately be converted
to analog forms in order to be displayed, 
DRM systems suffer 
from an <i>analog hole</i> that fundamentally limits their efficacy. 
End users can ultimately copy these analog audio/picture/video forms,
though such copies may suffer from reduced quality. 

<p>Although DRM technology can often be circumvented, it is not legal to do so
in the US. This is a consequence of the <i>Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA)</i>, 
a 1998 US law that includes an anti-circumvention provision that 
outlaws devices and methods for bypassing DRM.  Even telling others how to 
circumvent DRM appears to violate this provision. 
Even providing a link to a CSS descrambler might be illegal, 
but CMU CS professor <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/">David Touretzky</a> doesn't think so!
The <i>DMCA</i> was championed by 
the music and film industries. Free speech advocates 
claim that the DMCA is at odds with the First Amendment, and critics
call it <i>Digital Millenium Competition Avoidance</i>.
