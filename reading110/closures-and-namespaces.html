    <h1>Closures and Namespaces</h1>
<p>A closure is a special kind of function, and a namespace is a way that a
programming language can support separation of code. Consequently, you'll
learn more about these concepts in CS 250 (Programming Languages), but
they are important, practical concepts that arise naturally in JavaScript
code, so we'll learn about them now.</p>
<h2>What is a Closure?</h2>
<p>Formally, a closure is a function plus an environment (you can read more
about them in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)">Wikipedia article on
Closures</a>,
so begin getting a handle on them, we start with some observations about
functions.</p>
<h2>Functional Programming</h2>
<p>The following functions <code>f1</code> and <code>f2</code> depend only on their inputs (rather
than on some global state information), which makes them easier to
understand than the function <code>g1</code> which depends on some global variable
<code>glob</code>. (For example, suppose <code>glob</code> is a string: then the value of <code>g1</code>
is a string, too.)</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">var f1 = function (x y) { return x + y; };
var f2 = function (x) { return x + 4; };
var g1 = function (x) { return x + glob; };
</code></pre>

<p>When we talk about ''functional programming'' in Computer Science, we are
thinking about functions like <code>f1</code> and <code>f2</code>, where calling the functions
with the same inputs always yields the same output. The same can't be said
of <code>g1</code>. In general, when we say some code is <em>functional</em>, we mean that
it depends only on its arguments, not on external state (like <code>glob</code>) or
even internal state (its prior history of executions). We'll return to
this later.</p>
<p>Function <code>f1</code> is just the <code>add</code> function; we might call <code>f2</code> the <code>add4</code>
function. Since functions are first-class objects in JavaScript, we can
dynamically create them and return them from functions.  So, the following
function can create functions like <code>add4</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">var makeAdder = function (delta) {
    return function (x) { return x+delta; }
    };
var add4 = makeAdder(4);
alert(add4(3));
</code></pre>

<p>Now, what kind of function is <code>add4</code>? It's functional, in the sense that
its value only depends on its arguments, not on any global state
(certainly none that can change). Yet the code looks nearly the same as
<code>g1</code>.  What's the difference?  The difference is that the <code>glob</code> that <code>g1</code>
refers to is <em>global</em> and can change dynamically, while <code>delta</code> is a
<em>lexical</em> variable in the <em>environment</em> of the anonymous function returned
by <code>makeAdder</code>. That function includes both the function plus that bit of
environment, so it is a <em>closure</em>.</p>
<h2>An Example: A Shopping Example</h2>
<p>Let's see closures in action in a web page. Suppose we have a page that
has an item for sale, say apples, and it has an associated button that
increments a counter, updates a database, updates the web page and maybe
other things.  So, you write some code like this:</p>
<script>
function updateAppleDatabase(n) {
    console.log("Apple Database updated with "+n);
}
</script>

<div class="eg" id="apple-example"><form action="">
<p><output id="apple-clicks">0</output>
   Apples
   <button type="button" id="apple-button">click on Apples</button>
</p></form>
</div>

<p>Here's the HTML code:</p>
<pre id="apple-example_dst"></pre>

<p>And here's the JavaScript code:</p>
<script class="eg">var appleClicks = 0;
$("#apple-button").click(function () {
    appleClicks++;
    updateAppleDatabase(appleClicks);
    $("#apple-clicks").html(appleClicks);
    });
</script>

<p>The event handler function we've written is not <em>functional</em> (it depends
on the global variable <code>appleClicks</code>). Nevertheless, the code works fine.</p>
<p>Next, we decide to add additional buttons for bananas, coconuts, dates,
eggplants, figs and the rest of the alphabet. Of course, we could
copy/paste the code above for each of our grocery items, but copy/paste
usually a bad idea. Duplicate code means that if we change our
implementation, we have to update all the copies of the original
implementation.</p>
<h2>Event Handler Maker</h2>
<p>But how do we write a <q>generic</q> event handler? We could write a
function to make one. While we're at it, we'll make the
<code>updateAppleDatabase</code> function more generic.</p>
<script>
function updateDatabase(item,n) {
    console.log(item+" database updated with "+n);
}
</script>

<pre><code class="javascript">function groceryClickHandlerMaker(item,outputId) {
    var counter = 0;
    return function () {
         counter++;
         updateDatabase(item,counter);
         $(outputId).html(counter);
         };
}
</code></pre>

<script>
function groceryClickHandlerMaker(item,outputId) {
    var counter = 0;
    return function () {
         counter++;
         updateDatabase(item,counter);
         $(outputId).html(counter);
         };
}
</script>

<p>How do we use the <code>groceryClickHandlerMaker</code>?  Here are two examples, where we
invoke the <code>groceryClickHandlerMaker</code> function to return a <em>closure</em> that
we then attach as the click handler.</p>
<div id="fruit-example">
<form action="">
<p><output id="banana-clicks">0</output>
    Bananas
    <button type="button" id="bananas-button">click on Bananas</button>
</form>
<form action="">
<p><output id="coconuts-clicks">0</output>
    Coconuts
    <button type="button" id="coconuts-button">click on Coconuts</button>
</form>
</div>

<script class="eg" id="fruit2">
$("#bananas-button").click(groceryClickHandlerMaker("bananas","#banana-clicks"));
$("#coconuts-button").click(groceryClickHandlerMaker("coconuts","#coconuts-clicks"));
</script>

<p>Here's the JavaScript code. </p>
<pre id="fruit2_dst"></pre>

<h2>Closure Variables</h2>
<p>Let's look again at the <code>groceryClickHandlerMaker</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">function groceryClickHandlerMaker(item,outputId) {
    var counter = 0;
    return function () {
         counter++;
         updateDatabase(item,counter);
         $(outputId).html(counter);
         };
}
</code></pre>

<p>What variables does it close over? It closes over every variable that is
not defined within the function. Here there are three:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>item</code></li>
<li><code>outputId</code></li>
<li><code>counter</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The first two closure variables won't change ever, so the JavaScript
engine can really just substitute the values as static constants. The
counter, however, is interesting, because it's updated by the closure
invocation, which means that the closure isn't <em>functional</em> in the
technical sense of its behavior only depending on its arguments. Its
behavior depends on how many times its been executed before.</p>
<h2>Namespaces</h2>
<p>Some very cool properties of the <code>counter</code> variable used by the click
handlers above are that</p>
<ol>
<li>there are several of these variables, one for each handler</li>
<li>they all have the same name, but</li>
<li>they are all completely unrelated, and</li>
<li>they are all completely private</li>
</ol>
<p>Think about that last property for a moment: each click handler has its
own private state variable. (This should remind you of instance variables
in object-oriented programming.)  Indeed, each closure has its own private
<em>namespace</em>.</p>
<p>What's a namespace?  In general, a namespace is a mapping from names
(symbols) to values. You can think of the names as variables, as we will
here, since in JavaScript we can assign a function to a
variable. Namespaces are important in programming because they help us
avoid name <em>collisions</em>.  For example, many years ago, I was doing some
graphics programming and I has some variables that stored the hex codes for
various colors:</p>
<pre><code>var red = 0xff0000;
var white = 0xffffff;
var tan = 0xd2b48c;
var teal = 0x00ffff;
...
</code></pre>

<p>I also needed to compute the tangent of an angle:</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">var tan_theta = tan(theta);
</code></pre>

<p>I'm embarrassed to admit that it took me <em>hours</em> to understand why the
tangent function wasn't working. The problem was a name collision: I had
only one namespace, so <code>tan</code> could only have one value.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, the <code>tan</code> function is safely in the <code>Math</code> object and so we
say <code>Math.tan</code> to use it.  The <code>Math</code> object gives us a kind of namespace.
We could create one for Colors very easily in JavaScript using objects:</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">var Colors = {};
Colors.red = 0xff0000;
Colors.white = 0xffffff;
Colors.tan = 0xd2b48c;
Colors.teal = 0x00ffff;
</code></pre>

<p>We can put functions in the object as well, like the <code>tan</code> function is in
<code>Math</code>. Suppose we had a function <code>lighten</code> and we didn't want to clutter
up the global namespace with it. We could put it in <code>Colors</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">Colors.lighten = function (color) { ... };
</code></pre>

<p>This technique is very common in JavaScript programming.  Another, even
more common, is to use functions.</p>
<h2>Functions as Namespaces</h2>
<p>Let's take a very abstract example so that the details of the code don't
confuse the issue.  Suppose we want to have a bunch of global variables
and functions with short, succinct names for brevity.  The functions might
be mutually recursive, might refer to the globals, and so forth. After all
those definitions, the thing we actually want to do is compute <code>f(1)</code> and
insert the result into page . Our code might look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">
var a = 123;

var b = 456;

var f = function (n) { ... g(a*n); ... };

var g = function (x,y) { ... f(b*x)+f(b*y)...; }

$(&quot;#ans&quot;).html(f(1));
</code></pre>

<p>This code would work, but it would not be good software engineering,
because of the potential for namespace conflicts. So, we can just make all
these variables be <em>local</em> variables of a new, anonymous function that we
will immediately execute.</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">(function () {

     // code from above

})();
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that the function expression is wrapped in parentheses: that's
necessary so that it won't be treated as just a top-level function
definition. The parenthesized function expression is then followed by a
pair of empty parentheses which causes the function to be invoked. This is
called an Immediately Invoked Function Expression or IIFE. Wikipedia has
more about [Immediately Invoked Function
Expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/immediately-invoked_function_expression].</p>
<p>Using an IIFE means that <em>no</em> names are added to the global namespace, so
the code has no footprint at all. (The <q>footprint</q> of code is the set
of names that are added to the global JavaScript namespace.)</p>
<h2>Pitfalls of Closures: this and that</h2>
<p>Earlier, we learned that a closure will capture the values (<q>close
over</q>) all the names (variables) that aren't defined in its body. For
example:</p>
<pre><code>var c1 = (function () {
    count = 0;
    return function () { return ++count; }
}) ();
</code></pre>

<p>The closure <code>c1</code> closes over <code>count</code>.</p>
<p>When we learned about object-oriented programming in JavaScript, we
learned that the special variable <code>this</code> is bound to the object that the
method is executing on. Here's a reminder:</p>
<script class="eg">
function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.greeting = function () {
    return "hello, my name is "+this.name;
}

var alice = new Person("alice");
console.log(alice.greeting());    // `this` bound to alice
</script>

<p>Let's add a method that will create a greeting button for a person. Here's
the button. Try it and you'll see that it doesn't work. </p>
<div id="alice1"></div>

<script id="greetButton1" class="eg">
Person.prototype.greetButton1 = function (where) {
    $("<button>")
        .text(this.name)
        .click(function () { alert(this.greeting()); })
        .appendTo(where);
}

alice.greetButton1("#alice1");
</script>

<p>Here's the code to make the button. Can you see why it doesn't work?</p>
<pre id="greetButton1_dst"></pre>

<p>The click handler is a closure, referring to the special variable <code>this</code>
but that doesn't work, because when the click handler is invoked, <code>this</code>
has the value of the button, not the <code>Person</code> object (<code>alice</code>). What this
illustrates is that you <em>can't close over <code>this</code></em>.</p>
<p>What to do then?  In some cases, you can just copy the value you want into
a local variable that you <em>can</em> close over. For example, the following
works by copying the value to the variable <code>text</code> which we can close over:</p>
<div id="alice2"></div>

<script id="greetButton2" class="eg">
Person.prototype.greetButton2 = function (where) {
    var text = this.greeting();                          
    $("<button>")
        .text(this.name)
        .click(function () { alert(text); })
        .appendTo(where);
}

alice.greetButton2("#alice2");
</script>

<p>If you really need the object itself, the convention in JavaScript is to
copy the object from <code>this</code> to the variable <code>that</code> which isn't special and
so we can close over it:</p>
<div id="alice3"></div>

<script id="greetButton3" class="eg">
Person.prototype.greetButton3 = function (where) {
    var that = this;
    $("<button>")
        .text(this.name)
        .click(function () { alert(that.greeting()); })
        .appendTo(where);
}

alice.greetButton3("#alice3");
</script>
