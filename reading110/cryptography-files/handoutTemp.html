<P>Suppose Alice wants to send Bob the message:

<BLOCKQUOTE><p>Call off the attack, it's a trap! Signed, Alice</BLOCKQUOTE>
         
<P>She encrypts her message with Bob's public key and radios it to
him. Meanwhile, Eve sends Bob the message:
         
<BLOCKQUOTE><p>Go on with the attack, it's all clear! Signed, Alice</BLOCKQUOTE>
         
<P>She also encrypts the message with Bob's public key and radios it to
him. She's pretending to be Alice!  What is Bob to think?
         
<P>An important aspect of public key encryption: both keys can encrypt, and the two 
keys are opposites &ndash; one can decrypt what the other encrypts.
         
<P>So, here's what Alice does: she encrypts her message with her own
<EM>private</EM> key. Bob gets it and successfully decrypts it with
Alice's <EM>public</EM> key (posted on her website). Bob realizes that 
<EM>only</EM> Alice could have sent this message, since only her private key can 
create a message that her public key can decrypt.
         
<P>Thus, public key encryption can give us <strong><em> digital signatures
</em></strong>

<p>What if Alice and Bob are bad guys and Eve is the government? How can
the government eavesdrop on encrypted communications, to protect the public?
         
<P>Through the 90s, the U.S. government did several things:
         
 <UL>
           <LI>categorized strong crypto systems as
            <EM>munitions</EM>, like napalm and cluster bombs, making
            it illegal to export them from the US
            
            <LI>established the Data Encryption Standard (DES) and
            required computer manufacturers to use it for any
            encryption
            
            <LI>required that the government be given a copy of any key 
            generated, so law enforcement could decrypt any message 
            deemed necessary to decrypt 
 </UL>
         
<P>There was a lot of resistance from computer manufacturers, privacy
advocates, civil libertarians and others. The government eventually
caved in, but in our current climate, the desire to clamp down on 
cryptography will rise again!
