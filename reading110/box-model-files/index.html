         <p>Page layout involves placing page elements (such as text and graphics)
where you choose on a page.  In the past, page layout was done with
special HTML tags, including tables. The modern approach is to separate
the page layout from the page contents by using CSS.  This has the
advantage that you can have different layouts for different media
(screens, printouts, cellphones) as well as keeping the HTML clean and
uncluttered for those users who don't use the CSS, such as a blind person
who uses screen reading software.</p>
  
          <h2 id="boxes">Boxes</h2>
          
          <p>To understand page layout, you first have to understand that, to a web
  browser, a web page is a series
  of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html" title="the box
  model">boxes</a>.  The boxes have a width and height, and they get
  assembled (laid out) on the page, much the way Ben Franklin might have
  laid out the text and pictures in his newpaper.

</p><p>Boxes come in two kinds: <em>blocks</em> and <em>inline</em>.

</p><p>A <em>block</em> is something big like a paragraph or
a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.  Blocks are preceded and followed by line
breaks, so Ben Franklin or the layout engine stacks them vertically on the
page.  (Normally, a block doesn't have anything to the left or right,
though we will see some exceptions later.)</p>

<p>An <em>inline</em> element (box) is something like a word, where Ben
Franklin or the layout engine fills up a line with as many as it can, then
goes on to the next line, and so forth.  You may be surprised to learn
that <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> elements are inline, so that a line is
filled with as many images as will fit before starting the next line.
(That's why centering an image is tricky; we'll look at that a bit later.)
</p>

<h2 id="mbp">Margins, Borders and Padding</h2>

<p>The contents of a box can optionally be surrounded by a
  border.  For example, the following CSS

</p><pre>p {
    border: 2px dashed red;
}
</pre>

<p>will put a 2 pixel dashed red line around the contents of each
paragraph.

</p><p><em>Padding</em> is the distance between the contents of the box and
  the border.  By default, it's zero, but if you'd like a little more room
  between your text and the border, you can increase it.  Even if you
  don't have a border, padding can be used to increase the distance
  between the contents of your box and the contents of any neighboring
  boxes.

  </p><p><em>Margins</em> are the distance between the borders and the
  next element.  However, it's not quite as simple as that, because 
  the margins for vertical elements
  sometimes <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html#collapsing-margins">collapse</a>.

<!--h2 id="ex1">Exercise 1 Using Firebug</h2>

<p>If you haven't learned about Firebug, now's the
time: <a href="../../documentation/firebug/firebug.html">Firebug</a>.
Firebug is is a plugin for Firefox.  Get it, use it, enjoy it.  It's
awesome.-->

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger">
      <h4>Exercise 1</h4>    


<p>Look at this <a href="box-ex1.html">modifying boxes using Inspect Element</a>.
    (Dummy text courtesy of <a href="http://lipsum.com/">lipsum.com</a>.)


<p>In the exercise, you'll notice that contents of the box, including the
padding, acquire the background color, but the margins are always
transparent.  Thus, padding and margins, which seem to be interchangeable
when there isn't a border, aren't the same if you have a background color.

<p>You'll also notice some big differences between blocks and inline
  elements.  Not only are the inline elements put together on a line,
  but a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> can be broken up if it's too wide
  (certain inline elements, such as images, can't be broken up).
  Also, the width and height, and top and bottom margins of inline
  elements are completely ignored.</p>
  
  </div>

<!--p>You are probably wondering how to set all these distances.  There
are CSS properties to control the thickness of each side of the box
(margin, border, and padding) as well as the style of the border if
there is a border.  There are also shorthand forms that let you define
things more compactly.  Consult a
good <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_reference.asp"
title="CSS properties">reference on CSS properties</a-->.

<h2 id="units">Lengths and Units</h2>

<p style="text-indent: 0.5in;">Now that you've seen some CSS properties
whose values are <em>lengths</em>, you'll want to know what values they
can have.  For example, we indented this paragraph by half an inch.  It's
the only indented paragraph in the site.  We did it using the following
code:
</p>
          
<pre>&lt;p style="text-indent: 0.5in"&gt;Now that you've seen some CSS properties ...
</pre>

<p>You might guess that <code>in</code> means <q>inches.</q> To
specify lengths effectively, you need to know the <em>units</em> that
CSS uses.  They come in several categories:

</p><ul>

<li><em>Ruler measures.</em> Inches (<code>in</code>), centimeters
(<code>cm</code>), and millimeters (<code>mm</code>).

</li><li><em>Pixels.</em> These measures are in pixels, so they're less
flexible if the web page will be printed out onto paper, but they're
useful on the web.  This unit is specified using <code>px</code>.

</li><li><em>Printer units.</em> You probably know that font sizes are
measured in <em>points,</em> as in a <q>12 point font.</q>
One <em>point</em> is equal to 1/72 of an inch, and is specified by using
<code>pt</code>.  A <em>pica</em> is 12 points (<q>a pica
font</q>) and is specified by using <code>pc</code>.

</li><li><em>Font-relative units.</em> These measures are proportional to
the size of the font, so they are bigger if the font is bigger, 
and smaller if it's smaller.  This is great because visually impaired people
may increase the font size to much greater than you'd ever expect, and
you'd like the web page lengths to scale appropriately.  These are
appropriate measures for, say, the distance between lines (called the
<em>leading,</em> from strips of lead that were put between the rows of
type back in the olden days of actual lead type).  The two font-relative
sizes are <code>em</code> and <code>ex</code>.  The <code>em</code>
measure is named for the width of the letter <q>M</q> in the current font,
and in CSS is defined to be equal to the size of the font.  The
<code>ex</code> measure is named for the height of the letter <q>x</q> in
the current font, and in CSS is usually about half the size of the font.

</li><li><em>Percentages.</em> These are best for elements whose size you 
want to specify relative to the size of the enclosing element or the window.  
  <!--For
example, to make the body of the page be half the width of the window,
you can write:

<pre>&lt;body style="width: 50%"&gt; </pre-->

<p>If you want a paragraph to be three-fourths the width of
the enclosing <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, you can use code like the
following:

<pre>
div#content {
   width: 800px;
   margin-left: 100px;
}

p#note {
   width: 75%;
   margin-left: 25%;
}

&lt;div id="content"&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Here's the usual contents of the page ...&lt;/p&gt;
   ...
   &lt;p id="note"&gt;And here is a narrow note on the right side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<p>Look at the <a href="percentage.html" title="an example of setting paragraph widths using percentages">percentage example in action</a>.

</ul>

<!--h2>Unique Element Selectors</h2>

<p>You certainly noticed something else in the last few examples, namely
the use of an <code>id</code> attribute in the tag and the same id in the
selector for the style sheet.  For example, see the <code>content</code> and
<code>note</code> terms in the percentage example.  If you have one
particular element of your page that you want to specify the style of, you
can give it a unique identifier (id), and then specify the properties of
that element in your document-level or external style sheet.  For example,
your page might include the following:

<pre>
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;div id="navbar"&gt;
&lt;!-- markup for the navigation bar goes here --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<p>Then, in your style sheet, you specify this particular
<code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with the pound sign and its id:

<pre>
div#navbar {
   background-color: olive;
   ...
}   
</pre>

<p>There must be only one <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with that id.  For
brevity, if there is only one element with that id, you can omit the
element type, reducing the selector to just <code>#navbar</code>.

<p>Why not just use an inline style sheet?  There are several reasons,
all based on the idea of abstraction and separating structure from
presentation.  First, the element might be unique on a single web
page, but might occur on every page in your site.  For example, a
"maincontent" <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> might appear on every page, and
you can specify its style once in an external style sheet.  Second,
this separation can allow you to substitute a different style sheet,
perhaps for a different medium (such as a cell phone).  Third, it keeps
your HTML clean and uncluttered.

<p>You can name the element pretty much anything, but stick to
sequences of letters and numbers, rather than using more exotic
characters.-->

<!--div class="ex"><span class="ex">Exercise 2</span>

<p>Using your <a href="../L03-html/little.html">little.html</a> from
earlier exercises, modify the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag so that it is
80 percent of the page, and modify all the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags to
have a 5em indentation.  Make the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag have a
left margin of 10 percent, thereby centering the content on the page.

</p></div-->

<h2 id="inline_images">Images are Inline Elements</h2>

<p>Pictures (image elements, produced by the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag)
  are <em>inline</em> elements.  This may seem odd, since images look so
  much like big box-like things, and therefore ought to be <em>block</em>
  elements, but they are (by default), inline elements.  So, the browser
  treats them like big words.  Here's an example:

<div class="eg_box">
  <p>Bonnie and Chester were enjoying a picnic on the
  <img src="box-model-files/icons/grass.png" alt="grass">.  Suddenly the sky filled with dark
  <img src="box-model-files/icons/ic_menu_cloud.png" alt="clouds">.  Soon, it began to
  <img src="box-model-files/icons/weather-rain.png" alt="rain">.  When the
  <img src="box-model-files/icons/Lightning.png" alt="lightning"> began, they decided to
  head for
  <img src="box-model-files/icons/home.png" alt="home">.
</div>


<h2 id="centering">Centering Content</h2>

<p>Before we get to more complex stuff, let's look at centering content,
particularly images, since that's a common desire among CS110 students.
  Let's start, though, with centering lines of text within a block.
  Here's an eye chart:

<div class="verbatim example">
<div class="eg_box" style="text-align: center">
  <span style="font-size: 60px">E</span><br>
  <span style="font-size: 40px">F P</span><br>
  <span style="font-size: 30px">T O Z</span><br>
  <span style="font-size: 20px">L P E D</span><br>
  <span style="font-size: 15px">P E C F D</span><br>
  <span style="font-size: 12px">E F D C Z P</span><br>
  <span style="font-size: 10px">F E L O P Z D</span><br>
</div>
</div>

<p>All we had to do was to use the CSS property <code>text-align:
    center</code>.  (Note that we used an inline style sheet in the
    example code, just for brevity.  In practice, we would probably add a
    class to this div and define it in an external style sheet).

<p>Since images are just like big letters, the same trick will work with
  images:
  
<div class="verbatim example">
<div class="eg_box" style="text-align: center">
  <img src="box-model-files/icons/grass.png" alt="grass"><br>
  <img src="box-model-files/icons/ic_menu_cloud.png" alt="clouds">
  <img src="box-model-files/icons/weather-rain.png" alt="rain">
  <img src="box-model-files/icons/Lightning.png" alt="lightning"><br>
  <img src="box-model-files/icons/home.png" alt="home">
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="center_text">Centering Text</h2>

<p>You should almost never center lines of text in a paragraph.  You get ragged
edges left and right, which looks ugly.  Also, depending on the font,
amount of text and the width of the region, the last line may be
weirdly short (and centered).  Here's
  a <a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/27745.html">Tolkien quote</a>:

<div class="verbatim example">
<div class="eg_box tolkien_quote" style="text-align: center;">
  Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle and quick
  to anger.
</div>
</div>

<p>You probably don't want that single word centered on the second
  line.  But that can happen (and all-too-often does) when you center text
  and don't have complete control over browser-width, font-size, and the
  like.

<p>Instead, what you probably want is to have normal, left-aligned text in
  a box that is itself centered.  Let's see how to center boxes.

<h2 id="center_block">Centering a Block</h2>

<p>To center a block, you have to give it a width that is smaller than
  its parent (which might be the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>), and setting its
left and right margins to be <code>auto</code>.  <q>Auto</q> means to take
the leftover space on the line and distribute it equally among the
<q>auto</q> elements.  If both margins are <code>auto</code>, the element
is centered.  Thus:

<div class="verbatim example">
<div style="width: 400px; border: 3px solid blue;">
<p style="border: 2px solid red; width: 250px; margin: 0 auto;">
  Do not meddle in the affairs of wizards, for they are subtle and quick
  to anger.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="center_image">Centering Images</h2>

<p>An alternative technique for centering images is to use the same margin
  trick that works for centering other block elements, such as the
  paragraph above.  The difference is that <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is
  already a block element, while
<code>&lt;img&gt;</code> is inline.  However, we can change an
<code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element to be a block by using the
<code>display: block</code> style.  That is, to make an image that
is centered, use a style sheet that makes the image <a
href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/css/classification/display.html"><code>display</code></a>
as a <code>block</code>, and sets the <a
href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/css/box/margin-left.html"><code>margin-left</code></a>
and <a
href="http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/css/box/margin-right.html"><code>margin-right</code></a>
to <code>auto</code>.

<div class="verbatim example">
<p>
  <img src="box-model-files/buffypics/buffy.gif" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Buffy Summers">
  <img src="box-model-files/buffypics/angel.gif" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" alt="Angel">
</div>

<p>Note that by making the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> be <code>block</code>,
they stack vertically, even without the <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tags.  If
we had tried to use the <code>text-align: center</code> technique, the two
pictures would have appeared next to each other on the line. (Of course,
that may be what you <em>want</em>, in certain circumstances.)

<p>You should consult this web reference on <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/center.html">Centering
Things in CSS</a>.</p>

<h2 id="width">Box Widths</h2>

<p>Consider the following example of <a href="overfull-box.html">an
overfull box</a>.  Look at the CSS for it.  Why does the browser have a
horizontal scroll bar?  The box is 100% of the container, not 110%.</p>

<p>The solution to this mystery is that the width of a box is defined to
be the width of its <em>contents</em>, not the width of the box.  (If you
think this is a stupid definition, you would find many who agree with you,
but we're stuck with this definition.)  Thus, if you define a box to be
100%, it had better not have any margin, border, or padding, or it will
be <q>overfull</q>.</p>

<p>One way to avoid the creation of overfull boxes is to nest two boxes, 
set the width of the outer one, and
then use the inner one to set the margins, border and padding.  By
default, the dimensions of the inner box will be determined by the outer
one, which is just what you want.  Here is an example of
a <a href="full-box.html">full, not overfull box</a> created with this idea.
