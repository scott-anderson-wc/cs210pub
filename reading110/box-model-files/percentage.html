      <p>It's a series of paragraphs, just as you'd expect.</p>
      
      <p>We specified a background color and margins, so the boxes would stand out.</p>
        
      <p>There would probably be a lot of them, but we're not going to bother.    
        Still, we're going to have one that's wide enough to actually see the edges of the box.</p>
      
      <p id="note">And here is a narrow note on the right side.    
        Try adjusting the size of your browser window, both wider and narrower, 
        and see how the widths adjust.
