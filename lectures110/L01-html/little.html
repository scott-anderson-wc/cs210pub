   <h1>A First Exercise</h1>

   <h2>Getting Started</h2>

   <ol>
   <li>Save this page as "little.html" on your <em>desktop</em> using
   the File/Save As menu item in Firefox, Safari or IE.  

   <p>Be sure to change the <strong>format</strong> of the saved page
   <ul> 
        <li>In Firefox, change the "Format" to <strong>Web Page, HTML only</strong> (not Web Page, complete)
        <li>In IE, change the "Format" option to <strong>HTML Source</strong> (not Web Archive).
	<li>In Safari, change the "Format" to <strong>Page Source</strong> (not Web Archive)
   </ul>

   <li>Next, launch TextWrangler.  If it's not on your dock, you an click
   on the Finder (leftmost on the dock), then Go/Applications and scroll
   down until you see TextWrangler.

   <li>Finally, open the file:  File/Open and choose "little.html" from
   the desktop.

   </ol>

   <h2>Continuing</h2>

   <p>Edit the file with TextWrangler, save the changes, and view the
   results in your local web browser just by opening "little.html" (you
   can even drag "little.html" from your desktop to the browser).  There
   is no need to transfer the file to Puma; you can view the local copy
   more quickly and easily.

   <P>Switch back to TextWrangler, make more changes, save them, switch to
   your browser, and reload the changes.  Repeat as necessary.
