  <h2 id="arrays">Arrays</h2>
      <p>So far we have seen four kinds of data types in Javascript: numbers, strings,
                                        booleans, and objects (e.g. Date). A special kind of object that is commonly used in 
                                Javascript and other programming languages is an <em>Array</em>. Arrays are
                                        very useful to store collections of values together under one name. Let's 
                                        see some examples:</p> 
                                        
                                        <pre>
var weekDays = ["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"];

var months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"];

var monthDays = [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31];
</pre>
                                        
<p>Notice how we can create an array by simply using the square brackets notation
                                        <code>[ ]</code> and separating with comma the values inside them.
                                        Such notation is known as creation of an <em>array literal</em> (can you notice
  the similarity with the <a href="objectliterals.html">object literal</a>?. In books and
                                        the Web you will see other ways to create arrays, that are a bit more complex.
                                        A common one uses the the constructor notation, see example:</p>        
                                        
                                        <pre>
var powersOfTwo = new Array();
powersOfTwo[0] = 1;
powersOfTwo[1] = 2;
powersOfTwo[2] = 4;
powersOfTwo[3] = 8;
</pre>
          
 <p>As you can see, this is a verbose way for creating and populating arrays with values, and we will avoid it.
        However, it showcases how we can access the elements of the array: by using <em>index</em>
        values (which, as always in Javascript will start at 0). Notice how in this case the 
         square brackets are used for another purpose, to access a certain element of the array,
         based on the value of its index. In English, we read the statement 
         <code>powersOfTwo[0] = 1;</code> as <q>powerOfTwo <em>sub</em> 0 gets value 1</q>.
         (<em>sub</em> is the short form of the word <em>subscript</em>).
         Now, let us see a useful example of using arrays for websites.</p>        
                                        
        <div class="bs-callout bs-callout-danger">
                <h4 id="ex1">Exercise 1: Display the day name</h4>      
                As you know, the Javascript object <code>Date</code> has a method <code>.getDay()</code>
                that returns a number from 0 to 6 to refer to the day of the week, not its name. 
                This makes sense, since weekdays in different countries are named differently.
                Below is a Javascript program that uses
                arrays to display the right name of the day based on the language of your browser. 
                The browser is represented within the DOM model by the object <code>navigator</code>. Using 
                the properties and methods of the <code>navigator</code> you can access different kinds
                of information, such as the browser type or your geolocation.
        </div>                          
        
<div>
<textarea rows=18 cols=100 style="width: 100%">
var userLang = navigator.language; // collects the language code: "en-US", "fr-FR", etc.
var weekDays = []; // empty array, will be assigned values later
var message = ""; // empty string to store the message we will show
if (userLang == "en-US") {
        weekDays = ["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"];
        message = "Today is ";
}
else if (userLang == "fr-FR"){
        weekDays = ["Dimanche", "Lundi", "Mardi", "Mercredi", "Jeudi", "Vendredi", "Samedi"];
        message = "Aujourd'hui c'est ";
}
// We can have more else-if statements here for other languages
var today = new Date();              // get current date
var dayIndex = today.getDay();       // get value for day of week
alert(message + weekDays[dayIndex]); // display full message
</textarea><br>
<button onclick="eval(this.parentNode.firstElementChild.value);">Execute it</button>       
</div>
<br>            
<p>In the variable <code>dayIndex</code> we store a numerical value (a number from 0 to 6) that represents
  the day, and then we use that value as an index to access the day name from the <code>weekDays</code>
  array. Assuming the value for <code>dayIndex</code> is 3, the expression <code>weekDays[dayIndex]</code>
  will return the value "Wednesday".

        <h4>Properties and Methods of Arrays</h4>
        <p>An array object has many useful properties and methods. While you might not need
        most of them, it's worth to be aware of what's available. W3Schools has 
        <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_array.asp">a list of
        all of them</a>, together with snippets of Javascript code to explain each.</p>
        <p>Here are the ones you should know:
                <ul>
                        <li><code>.length</code> - a property that returns the number of elements in an array</li>
                        <li><code>.push()</code> - a method that adds new elements at the end of an array</li>
                        <li><code>.indexOf()</code> - a method that returns the index of an element in the array</code></li>
                  <li><code>.pop()</code> - a method that removes the last element from an array</code></li>
                        <li><code>.sort()</code> - a method that sorts the elements of an array</code></li>
        </ul>
                Play with the following code to understand each of them.
        </p>

<h2 id="forArrays"><code>for</code> loops for Arrays</h2>
<p>Imagine that you run a website about new paperback book releases, and every 
        week you have to update one page with the new titles and their prices. Here is 
        the HTML code for a few entries of the page:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;div id="newbooks"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Mockingjay &lt;span&gt;$4.99&lt;/span&gt;&lt/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fahrenheit 451 &lt;span&gt;$2.99&lt;/span&gt;&lt/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Persuasion &lt;span&gt;$1.99&lt;/span&gt;&lt/p&gt;
  ...
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>This markup is very simplified, you can imagine that we would also have the author name for 
every book, together with a link to the description and buy page. Manually updating this content
every week is tedious work. </p>

<p>It makes sense to automate this process and because the structure of the page is 
repetitive, we can use a <em>loop</em> to organize our code. We will show the code and
its results below and then explain how it works. Click on the "Execute it" button to
see the results in the blue-bordered box.</p>

  <h4 id="ex3">Exercise 3: Dynamic HTML with Arrays and Loops</h4>
<div>
<textarea style="width: 100%;" rows=13 cols=80>
var books = ["Mockingjay", "Fahrenheit 451", "Persuasion", "Middlemarch"]; // line 1
var prices = ["$4.99", "$2.99", "$1.99", "$0.99"];                         // line 2
var divElement = document.querySelector("#newbooks");                      // line 3
var html = "";                                                             // line 4
        
for (var i=0; i < books.length; i=i+1){                                    // line 5
    var oneLine = "<p>" + books[i] + " <span>" + prices[i] + "</span></p>";  // line 6
    html = html + oneLine;                                                 // line 7 
}
divElement.innerHTML = html;                                               // line 8
</textarea><br>
<button onclick="eval(this.parentNode.firstElementChild.value);">Execute it</button> 
</div>

<div id="newbooks">
</div>

<p>For this solution, we imagine that we received two arrays of titles and prices 
        (maybe they were columns in a spreadsheet).
By plugging them in in the Javascript code, the page will show the new content 
        every time we have new data.</p>

<p>Let us explain each line of code.</p>
        <ul>
                <li>Line 1 declares the array <code>books</code> that stores a list of book titles.</li>
          <li>Line 2 declares the array <code>prices</code> that stores the corresponding prices for each book. 
                These two arrays have the same length.</li>
                <li>Line 3 declares a variable that will refer to the div element in the HTML page where
                the book titles will be displayed. (In our example, it refers to the blue-bordered box.)</li>
                <li>Line 4 declares a variable that will store the HTML code we will generate automatically.
                Initially its value is an empty string.</li>
                <li>Line 5 is the statement that declares a <code>for</code> loop. This loop repeats the same
                statements (line 6 and 7) inside its <code>{ }</code> for a certain number of times (the 
          length of the array). Some time
                you'll see the expression <code>i++;</code> as a shortcut for <code>i = i + 1;</code>.</li>
        <li>Line 6 assigns to the variable <code>oneLine</code> the string value created by 
      concatenating together some HTML tags and their text values from the two arrays of data.</li>
                <li>Line 7 is a reassignment statement. Every time it concatenates new lines of HTML code to the
                        variable <code>html</code>.</li>
                <li>Line 8 sets the <code>innerHTML</code> property of <code>divElement</code> to the created new HTML code.</li>
        </ul>

<p>Play with the given code. Add more book titles and prices to the two arrays or change the order of the
items. Then execute the code again. Notice how every time it does the right thing. (If you are wondering
about the styling of the created elements, our HTML file has document-level CSS styles for 
the elements <code>#newbooks p</code> and <code>#newbooks span</code>.)</p>

<p>Let us now turn our attention to the <code>for</code> loop, which was a new construct you have not
encountered before.</p>

<figure class="text-center">
        <img src="images/for-loop.png" alt="for loop syntax" class="img-thumnail">
        <figcaption>The syntax of a <code>for</code> loop.</figcaption>
</figure>

A <code>for</code> loop consists of up to three statements inside the parentheses immediately following 
the keyword <em>for</em>, as well as a body of statement(s) enclosed in curly braces (<code>{ }</code>).

<ol>
        <li>The first statement is an assigment statement that declares a variable that will serve as 
        an index for the array. Most commonly you'll see the statement <code>var i = 0;</code>
        in this position. This statement is executed <strong>only the first time</strong> we enter the loop.</li>
        <li>The second statement contains a boolean expression that tests whether the loop should continue
        to be executed. This is evaluated in every iteration. In the moment that the expression evaluates
        to <code>false</code>, the loop is ended.</li>
        <li>The third statement updates the index variable, so that the loop can eventually end
        after a certain number of iterations. Failing to update the index variable, will put the program
        in a state of an endless loop which will eventually crash the browser.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is how to explain a <code>for</code> loop in plain English: for as long as the 
        test condition is true, keep repeating the code inside the body of the loop. This is 
        what happens in every step of the loop in the example with
        the book titles.</p>

<p>A common visualization of a <code>for</code> loop is a flowchart like
  the following.  You can see how the <code>index assignment</code> comes
  before the loop, the <code>condition statement</code> (actually
  a <em>boolean expression</em>) determines whether to start loop and to
  continue looping, and the <code>update statement</code> comes at the end
  of the loop to set things up for the next test of the condition.  Here's
  the flowchart:

  <p><img src="for-loop-flowchart.png" alt="flowchart of a for loop">

<p>Let's walk through the preceding particular example of a loop in great detail:

<p><code>for</code> loops are one of the most important programming constructs in
every programming language. Understanding how to write and use them properly will make you
a better programmer.</p>


<h2 id="loops-over-objects">Loops over Lists of Objects</h2>

<p>So far, we've seen lists (arrays) of numbers and strings. Let's look at
  lists that contain objects, since objects can have more interesting
  stuff in them.  This is really just a combination of two things you
  already have some understanding of:
  <ul>
    <li>objects, which are collections of propeties and their
    corresponding values. The values can be accessed by the name of the
    property.
      
    <li>lists, which are collections of things. The list elements can be
    accessed by their <em>index</em>.
  </ul>

<p>We'll do this by way of an example. In the book list above, we had two
  matching lists of equal length, so that <code>books[i]</code> is the
  title and <code>prices[i]</code> is the corresponding price.  If these
  two lists got out of sync, the price wouldn't match the object, and
  everything would be messed up in a way that would be hard to fix if
  there were thousands of books.

<p>A better way to structure the data is a single list of objects, where
  each object describes a book. (Imagine pulling this data out of a
  spreadsheet or database.)  Here's the example:

<pre>
var books = [{title: "Mockingjay", author: "Suzanne Collins", price: "$4.99", year: 2010},
             {title: "Fahrenheit 451", author: "Ray Bradbury", price: "$2.99", year: 1953},
             {title: "Persuasion", author: "Jane Austen", price: "$1.99", year: 1818},
             {title: "Middlemarch", author: "George Eliot", price: "$0.99", year: 1874}
]
</pre>

<p>Now, suppose we want to put that data on the page, with some
  surrounding HTML for formatting and such.  The pattern might look like
  this:

<pre>
&lt;span class="title"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by &lt;span class="author"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. 
First published in &lt;span class="year"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Current price: &lt;span class="price"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</pre>

<p>Our strategy is to loop over all the books, and for each book, do the
  following:
  <ol>
    <li>create a new <code>P</code> element.
      
    <li>set the <code>innerHTML</code> of the element to the code above.
      
    <li>copy the values out of the object and into the corresponding
    spans, using the class name as a CSS-style <em>query selector</em>.

  </ol>

<p>Here's the code, as an exercise:

  {title: "Persuasion", author: "Jane Austen", price: "$1.99", year: 1818},
  {title: "Middlemarch", author: "George Eliot", price: "$0.99", year: 1874}
];       /* 1 */

var divElement = document.querySelector("#books");                     /* 2 */

var oneBook = '<span class="title"></span> by <span class="author"></span>. ' 
 + 'First published in <span class="year"></span>. '
 + 'Current price: <span class="price"></span>'; /* 3 */
        
for (var i=0; i < books.length; i=i+1){  /* 4 */                                    
  var p = document.createElement("p");   /* 5 */
  p.innerHTML = oneBook;                 /* 6 */
  var book = books[i];                   /* 7 */
        
  /* 8 */
  p.querySelector(".title").innerHTML = book.title;
  p.querySelector(".author").innerHTML = book.author;
  p.querySelector(".price").innerHTML = book.price;
  p.querySelector(".year").innerHTML = book.year;

  divElement.appendChild(p);                                    /* 9 */
}

</div>

<div id="books">
</div>

<p>Here's a step-by-step explanation:
<ul>
<li>Step 1 creates the list of objects describing each book
<li>Step 2 gets the element on the page that we're going to append these to
<li>Step 3 sets a string literal containing our HTML template
<li>Step 4 is our loop control structure
<li>Step 5 creates an empty paragraph, currently not attached to the document
<li>Step 6 sets the innerHTML of the paragraph, creating the desired elements
<li>Step 7 gets the current element of the list
<li>Step 8 sets all the span contents from the corresponding object properties
<li>Step 9 attaches the paragraph to the document
</ul>

<p>You can see how this might be used to format data coming from the
  server, such as a Facebook update, the arrival of some new mail from
  Gmail, and so forth.  Loops over lists of objects is a general and
  powerful technique.

<h2 id="forObjects" style="border-top: 2px solid rgb(46,154,211); padding-top: 1ex;"><code>for</code> loops for Object Properties</h2>

<p>This section is considered advanced material, and we will not be using
  it this semester. Reading it is entirely optional. However, it's here
  for the interested reader.

<p>The four assignment statements in the previous example can be replaced
  by a more general and abstract mechanism that allows us to loop over the
  properties of an object.  JavaScript provides a special variant of
  the <code>loop</code> statement to do exactly that.  

<p>How would we create our books page using this special loop?  We will
use a <code>for</code> loop to iterate through all the books in the array
and another <code>for</code> loop to iterate through the properties of
every book object. These two <code>for</code> loops have slightly
different syntax, to reflect the fact that one works with an array and the
other with properties of an object.</p>



<p>We will again show the code that generates the page and then discuss the special 
<code>for</code> syntax for objects. Click on the "Execute it" button to see the results 
        in the blue-bordered box.</p>

<p>Although this example has twice the amount of data from the one that used arrays,
the number of code lines we had to write is almost the same. Here is an explanation
of very line:</p>

<ul>
                <li>Line 1 declares the array <code>books</code> that stores a list of book <strong>objects</strong>.</li>
                <li>Line 2 declares the variable <code>divElement</code>that will refer to the 
                        div element in the HTML page where the book entries will be displayed.</li>
                <li>Line 3 declares the variable <code>oneBook</code> that contains the HTML template af a line that
        will display the book information. Notice that we are using four <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>
        elements with class names, in order to allow for their styling with CSS. But all these <code>span</code>
        elements have no text, it will be added through our code.</li>
                <li>Line 4 is the statement that declares a <code>for</code> loop that will iterate over
        all items in the array <code>books</code>.</li>
                <li>Line 5 creates a new HTML element for the tag <code>p</code>. This will be used to store
        display every book line.</li>
                <li>Line 6 sets the <code>innerHTML</code> property of the newly created <code>p</code>
                        to the desired template.</li>
          <li>Line 7 declares the variable <code>book</code> that stores one book object at a time.</li>
        <li>Line 8 is the <code>for</code> statement that will iterate over all property names
        of a book object.</li>
        <li>Line 9 is an assignment statement. On the right side, <code>book[propName]</code> will
                be evaluated to the property values such as "Mockingjay", etc. The left side
        refers to the <code>span</code> element that will display as content such values. For example:
        <code>p.querySelector(".title").innerHTML</code>. In order for this "trick" to work,
        we have to ensure that the class names for the span elements are the same as the properties
        of the book objects. This way, they can be created by concatening <code>"." + propName</code>.</li>
        <li>Line 10 appends every created (and populated with information) <code>p</code>
        element to the container that will display all the books.</li>
        </ul>

<p>Notice in line 8 the new syntax of the <code>for</code> loop. It is much simpler
than the one we saw for iterating over elements of an array. In English we can read
<code>for (var propName in book) {// statement(s);}</code> like this: for every property name in 
the <code>book</code> object, store the name in the variable <code>propName</code>, and then
execute the body of the loop. 

<p>Below is an example that shows a loop for only one of the book objects:</p>

<pre>
var book = {title: "Mockingjay", author: "Suzanne Collins", price: "$4.99", year: 2010};
for (var propName in book){
        console.log("property name is: " + propName + ". Its value is: " + book[propName]);
}
</pre>
<p>If you copy these lines in the console, you'll see the following result:</p>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-warning">
        <h4>Important: Two ways to access values of properties</h4>
    <p>In the examples of this lecture we saw two different ways to access the values
    of object properties:
    <ol>
    <li>Using the <code>.</code> notation, as in: <code>person.firstName</code>.</li>
    <li>Using the <code>[]</code> operator, as in <code>book[propName]</code>.</li>
    </ol>
    Both of them return the value stored in that property but they cannot be 
    used interchangeably. For example, we cannot write  
    <code>person[firstName]</code> or <code>book.propName</code>. In the first case, 
    Javascript will complain
    of a ReferenceError, in the second case it will not complain but it will return
    <em>undefined</em>, instead of the value. Therefore, remember these rules when 
    accessing properties:
    <ul>
    <li>Use the <code>.</code> notation when you are directly referring to a property
    by its name. For example: <code>book.year</code>, <code>person.firstName</code>.</li>
    <li>Use the <code>[]</code> operator when you are using a variable that was assigned
    the name of the property. For example, <code>book[propName]</code>.</li>
    </ul>
