    <div id="overfull">
      <p>No matter how wide you make your browser, you'll never be able to get
      rid of the horizontal scroll bar.  That's because this div has a CSS
      stylesheet that says that its width is 100%.  That's 100% of the
      containing block, which is the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, and the width
      of that is determined by the <code>&lt;window&gt;</code>.

      <p>So far, so good.  So, why the scroll bar?  The <em>used</em> width of
      this div is 62px more than 100%, because of the left and right borders,
      margins, and padding that it has.  So, if the window is 500px, this div
      is 562 pixels.  If we make the window 1000px, this div is 1062px.  If we
      make the window a million pixels wide, this div will be a million plus
      62 pixels.

      <p>Because it's wider than the window, it gets a horizontal scroll bar.

      <p>So, the message here is that the width of an element for the purposes
      of <em>layout</em> (sometimes called the <em>used</em> width) is the
      content width <em>plus</em> the sum of the widths of the borders,
      margins and padding.
