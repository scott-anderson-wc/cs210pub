         <h2>Computer Organization</h2>

         <p>Computers have changed a lot in the hardware details over the
         decades, yet they are still using a fundamental architecture that
         hasn't changed very much at all.

         <h2>Quiz Question Nr. 1</h2>

          <p>Which of the following is not part of a computer:
            <ol type="A">
              <li><p>ALU</p></li>
              <li><p>CPU</p></li>
              <li><p>BLU</p></li>
              <li><p>bus</p></li>
              <li><p>RAM</p></li>
              <li><p>clock</p></li>
            </ol>

         <h2>Quiz Question Nr. 2</h2>

          <p>The clock does the following:
            <ol type="A">
              <li><p>Determines the speed of the processor</p></li>
              <li><p>Determines the speed of the memory</p></li>
              <li><p>Sets the timestamp for files and network I/O</p></li>
              <li><p>Synchronizes with GPS satellites</p></li>
              <li><p>all of the above</p></li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Binary Numbers</h2>

            <p>It may be surprising, but we can create any number we want
            out of just two digits, zero and one. These two <em>binary
            digits</em> are called <em>bits</em>.

              <h2>Powers of Two</h2>

            <p>Essential to creating binary numbers is knowing your powers
            of two.  You'll soon be able to create the following table
            quickly and reliably:

              <blockquote><table>
                  <tbody>
                    <tr><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>2</td><td>4</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>3</td><td>8</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>4</td><td>16</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>5</td><td>32</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>6</td><td>64</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>7</td><td>128</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>8</td><td>256</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>k</td><td>2<sup>k</sup></td></tr>
                    <tr><td>log<sub>2</sub>(n)</td><td>n</td></tr>
                  </tbody>
                </table>
              </blockquote>

         <h2>Quiz Question Nr. 3</h2>

          <p>The binary equivalent of 5 is
            <ol type="A">
              <li><p>5</p></li>
              <li><p>10000</p></li>
              <li><p>110</p></li>
              <li><p>101</p></li>
            </ol>

         <h2>Quiz Question Nr. 4</h2>

          <p>The decimal equivalent of the binary number 1010 is
            <ol type="A">
              <li><p>6</p></li>
              <li><p>5</p></li>
              <li><p>12</p></li>
              <li><p>none of the above</p></li>
            </ol>

          <p>Let's also try some of the following numbers:
            <ul>
              <li>20

              <li>40

              <li>80
                
              <li>127
                
              <li>255
                
              <li>67
                
              <li>115

              <li>49

              <li>48

            </ul>

            <p>There are some interesting observations to make about those
            numbers:
              <ul>
                <li>What happens when a number is multiplied by two or a
                power of two?
                  
                <li>What does a number look like when it is a power of
                two?
                  
                <li>What does a number look like when it is near a power
                of two?
              </ul>


            <h2>Characters, ASCII and Unicode</h2>

            <p>Once we have numbers, we can represent characters and text
            by simply numbering the characters.

            <ul>
              <li>Typically, each character is represented in a fixed
              width (1 byte or 2 bytes) or a small variety of widths. This
              may require <q>leading zeros</q>
                
              <li>ASCII is very old, extremely well-supported, and limited
              to 256 characters
                
              <li>Unicode is relatively modern (though decades old), still
              dodgy in its support, and has few practical limits (billions
              of characters).
                
              <li>There are other odd issues to deal with, such as
              encoding of line-endings.
            </ul>

            <p>Here's
            the <a href="../../reading/information-representation.html#text_rep">ASCII Table</a>

<figure class="text-center">
  <img src="../../reading/information-representation-files/ascii.gif"
       ALT="Part of the ASCII character set"
       class="img-thumbnail">
  <figcaption>Part of the ASCII character set table. To find the code for
  a particular character in the table, add its row number on the left (32,
  48, etc.) to its column number on top. So, for example, capital A is
  represented by decimal number 64 + 1 or 65.
  </figcaption>
</figure>     

         <h2>Quiz Question Nr. 5</h2>

          <p>What is 67 expressed as ASCII?
            <ol type="A">
              <li><p>A</p></li>
              <li><p>B</p></li>
              <li><p>C</p></li>
              <li><p>none of the above</p></li>
            </ol>

          <p>What are 115, 49 and 48 expressed as ASCII?

            <h2>Quiz Question Nr. 6</h2>

            <p>How many bits to represent the decimal number 1,000?

            <ol type="A">
              <li><p>9</p></li>
              <li><p>10</p></li>
              <li><p>11</p></li>
              <li><p>it can't be determined from the given information</p></li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Limited Number Representations</h2>

          <p>The fact that ASCII uses a limited number of bits has
          important implications. It can't represent an unbounded number
          of characters. This is true of <em>all</em> representations that
          use a limited number of bits.
            <ul>
              <li>Did you hear about how Psy broke YouTube's view
              counter? That's because YouTube used a fixed-size counter.
                
              <li>Did you hear that the internet is
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion">running
              out of IP addresses</a>?
                
            </ul>

            <h2>Quiz Question Nr. 7</h2>

            <p>It's happens to be the case
            that <code>.wellesley.edu</code> is a "class B" domain, which
            means all the IP addresses are of the form 149.130.x.y where x
            and y are 8-bit numbers.  When your device connects to our
            network, it gets assigned one of those IP addresses.

              <p>How many devices can connect to the Wellesley network
              before we <em>run out</em> of IP addresses?

                <ol type="A">

                  <li>1,000,000

                  <li>256
                    
                  <li>2<sup>16</sup>
                    
                  <li>none of the above
                    
                </ol>

                <h2>Bits and Color</h2>

                <p>Next time, we'll learn about colors, color primaries,
                and representations of colors.  It will turn out that
                computers almost always use 24 bits to represent a color.

                  <h2>Quiz Question Nr. 8</h2>

                  <p>How many colors is that?

                <ol type="A">
                  <li>10<sup>24</sup>
                    

                  <li>2<sup>24</sup>
                    
                  <li>24,000
                    
                  <li>24,000,000
                    
                </ol>
              

            <h2>Deja Vu</h2>

            <p>If there's time, return to last class and cover remaining
                activities.
