<!-- Minor changes by Ellen for Fall '10 - removed link to www.cstc.org for 
     more on conversion between number systems - link not working

     Minor changes by Scott:  added more interesting links about 
     high-level hardware diagrams and replaced the old diagram.

     Spring '12.  Added important section on the relationship beween size
     of the representation and its power.  Should add some exercises on
     binary.

     Fall '13, added info on volatile memory versus permanent storage.

<H1>How Computers Work</H1>

<div id="insert_TOC_here"></div>

<H2 id="components">Computer Components</H2>

<P>A computer is a complex electronic machine, but its operations can
be understood sufficiently in terms of a few interconnected components:</P>

<ul>
   <LI>The <em>Central Processing Unit</em> (used to be called the "brain"
   in the popular press). Since none of these words mean anything except
   the middle one, this is also called the <em>processor.</em> The
   processor is responsible for all the "intelligence" we associate with
   the computer. Its role is to follow a set of instructions written by
   the programmer and perform basic arithmetic calculations (like addition
   and number comparison).
   
   <LI>The <em>Memory Unit</em> where the data and the instructions are
   temporarily stored. 
   
   <LI>The <em>Input/Output Unit</em> allows the processor to communicate
   with the outside world, such as output to monitors or input from
   keyboard.

   <LI> The <em>clock</em>, a component that gives tempo (rhythm) to the
   operations.  When all else is equal, the faster the clock, the faster
   the computer.  Usually, all else is not equal, and the clock speed is
   more about marketing than computational speed.
</ul>

<P>The processor is further divided into two smaller components</P>

<UL>
   <LI>The <em>Arithmetic-Logic Unit</em> (ALU) performs the basic
   arithmetic calculations (think of it as a very simple
   "calculator")
   
   <LI>The <em>Control Unit</em> that follows the program's instructions
   and gives directions to the "calculator".
</UL>

<p>In the picture note that the components are connected through a set of 
        wires called the <em>bus</em>.

alt="computer model comprising processor, memory and I/O devices"></a>

<p>Other links worth exploring to learn about the fundamental hardware.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.kids-online.net/learn/click/table.html">Clickable
tower</a> has a picture of a real, albeit old, tower style computer but
with hotspots so that you can learn more.

<li><a href="http://www.practicalpc.co.uk/computing/what/parts.htm">What
are all the parts on my computer</a> has definitions of all sorts of
terms.   Quite up-to-date as of 2010.

<li><a href="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/inside-computer.htm">What's
inside my Computer</a> by Strickland, Jonathan.  23 September
2008, from HowStuffWorks.com. Looks like an excellent article if you want
to explore more.
(cited 26 September 2010).
</ul>

<P>The operations of any computer are as follows <EM>ad infinitum</EM>
("forever"):

<OL>
   <LI><EM>fetch</EM> instruction from memory</LI>
   
   <LI><EM>decode</EM> the instruction.  What is the processor supposed
   to do?  Add? Subtract?  Move some data to/from memory?</li>
   
   <LI><EM>execute</EM> the instruction.  This may involve such things
   as telling the processor to add two numbers, getting some data from
   memory, storing some data to memory, or telling some I/O device to
   do something.</LI>
   
   <LI><EM>REPEAT!</EM></LI>
</OL>

<p>This is called the <em>fetch/execute</em> cycle.  Note that the
processor is <em>so much</em> faster than the I/O devices, that I/O
doesn't appear prominently here.  A modern processor is able to execute
millions of instructions while waiting for an I/O device, even a fast
device like the disk or the network.

<p>The main point here is that the computer doesn't know how to do
anything "automatically": there's always some program code (set of
instructions) telling it how to do something.

<P>The input/output unit is connected with the usual peripherals such as
keyboard, mouse, the various "drives" (such as hard drives, floppy drives,
zip drives, DVD drives, CDROM drives, etc), monitors, printers etc. So,
the components and operations of a computer are remarkably
simple. Complication enters only for performance reasons, but any computer
that you are likely to see these days contains the above components.

<h2 id="kinds_of_memory">Kinds of Memory</h2>

<p>Looking at the picture above, you see a big yellow box
  labeled <q>Memory</q>, but you'll also see, if you look closely, <q>hard
  drive</q> attached to the bus. What's the difference?  Does it matter?

<p>Yes, it does.  The memory we describe there is super-fast memory chips
  that are right on the circuit board, just a few inches from the
  processor, what is sometimes
  called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">RAM
  or Random Access Memory</a>.  The most important properties of RAM are
  <ul>
    <li>It's super fast, so it's almost fast enough to keep up with the
    processor, and
      
    <li>it's <em>volatile</em>, which means that the information in it is
    lost if the power is removed.
  </ul>

<p>If you've ever lost a document you were working on using your computer
  because the power went out or your battery ran out, that's because the
  stuff you were working on was in <em>volatile</em> memory. The files
  that are <em>saved</em> on the <em>hard drive</em> weren't lost.

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive">hard
    drive</a> of your computer is (usually) a spinning disk with magnetic
    coating that stores the zeros and ones of your files as a pattern of
    magnetization.  The exact representation isn't important, but two
    properties of hard drives are crucial:

  <ul>
    <li>They are <em>slow</em>.  Even though the disks spin really fast
    and they can read and write bits faster than you can blink your eyes,
    they are <em>glacial</em> compared to the speed of the RAM.  They're
    at least a million times slower.
      
    <li>They are <em>non-volatile</em> or <em>permanent</em>.  Removing
    the power from a hard drive doesn't lose any information, and when the
    power is restored, you can get the information back.
  </ul>

<p>There are other kinds of drives, such as solid-state drives, but the
  same properties appear. These properties mean that your computer mostly
  works by copying information (both programs and data, such as your
  files) from long-term storage on the hard drive into fast memory in the
  RAM, and that's where it stays while the computer is running. But you
  should save your stuff in RAM to hard disk on occasion, in order to
  avoid losing your work should someone trip on your power cord and pull
  the plug, or your battery unexpectedly die.

<H2 id="info_rep">How information is represented</H2>

<P>To complete this simple description of a computer we need to explain
how the computer handles information: numbers, text, pictures, sound,
movies, instructions.

<P>The computer is an electronic device. Each of its wires can either
carry electric current or... not carry current. So, like a light switch,
it understands <EM>only two states</EM>. It turns out that this is enough
to make the whole idea work. In fact, any system that can represent at
least two states can represent information. Take, for example,
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code">Morse code</a> that
is used in telegraphy. Morse is a sound transmission system that can carry
a short beep (represented by a dot) and a long beeeeeep (represented by a
dash). Any letter or number can be represented by a combination of these
two symbols. Click here to see
a <A HREF="http://www.soton.ac.uk/~scp93ch/refer/morseform.html">Morse
translator</A>.

<P>Similarly with computers. To represent a number, we use the
<EM>binary</EM> arithmetic system, not the decimal number system that
we use in everyday life. In the binary system, any number can be
represented using only two symbols, 0 and 1. (Morse is almost, but not
quite (due to the pauses between letters) a binary system.  A system
closely related to Morse is used by computers to do data
compression (more about this later). Here is how the binary numbers
correspond to our decimal numbers:</P>

<P><TABLE class="numbers" BORDER=1>
   <TR>
      <TH>Decimal</TH><TH>Binary</TH>
    </TR>
   <tr><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
   <tr><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
   <tr><td>2</td><td>10</td></tr>
   <tr><td>3</td><td>11</td></tr>
   <tr><td>4</td><td>100</td></tr>
   <tr><td>5</td><td>101</td></tr>
   <tr><td>6</td><td>110</td></tr>
   <tr><td>7</td><td>111</td></tr>
   <tr><td>8</td><td>1000</td></tr>
   <tr><td>9</td><td>1001</td></tr>
   <tr><td>10</td><td>1010</td></tr>
   <tr><td>11</td><td>1011</td></tr>
   <tr><td>12</td><td>1100</td></tr>
   <tr><td>13</td><td>1101</td></tr>
   <tr><td>14</td><td>1110</td></tr>
   <tr><td>15</td><td>1111</td></tr>
</table>

<P>And so on. Both systems are <EM>positional</EM>: a great idea that we
owe to Arab mathematicians, because before them, <A
HREF="http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.roman.html">counting in
Roman</A> was tough (DCCCLXXXII + CXVIII = M, you know...)  and <A
HREF="http://www.math.tamu.edu/~dallen/history/gr_count/gr_count.html">counting
in Greek</A> was almost impossible (omega pi beta + rho iota eta = alpha).

<p>
<em>Positional</em> means that the position of each symbol within the
number determines its value. Thus, 3 has a different meaning in the
rightmost position than it has in the immediate left (30). We do it
without thinking, but we all know that the meaning of 1492 is:
<blockquote>
<p> 1492 = 1*1000 + 4*100 + 9*10 + 2*1
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, number 10011 in binary means 19 because
<blockquote>
<p>19 = 1*16 + 0*8 + 0*4 + 1*2 + 1*1
</blockquote>

<p> The decimal system is also called "base 10" and the binary "base 2".
You probably have not realized it, but you have been using the binary
system when you deal with old-fashioned units of measure:  8 ounces in a
  cup, two cups in a pint, two pints in a quart, four quarts in a gallon,
  and so forth.

<div style="padding: 30px; color: gray; border: 2px solid gray;">
  <p>There are lots of other old-fashioned units that are rarely used. Here's
  a complete set:

<p>
<TABLE border=0 cellpadding=6 width="100%">
<TR><TD>

<table border=1>
<tr> <td>
2 Jacks
</td>

<td>
1 Gill
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
2 Gills
</td>

<td>
1 Chopin

</tr>

<tr>
<td>
2 Chopins
</td>

<td>
1 Pint
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
2 Pints
</td>

<td>
1 Quart
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
2 Quarts
</td>

<td>
1 Pottle
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
2 Pottles
</td>

<td>
1 Gallon

</tr>

<tr>
<td>
2 Gallons
</td>

<td>
1 Peck

</table>

</TD>
<TD>

<table border=1>

<tr>
<td>
2 Pecks

<td>
1 DemiBushel

<tr>
<td>
2 DemiBushels

<td>
1 Bushel

</td>

<td>
1 Pipe
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
2 Pipes
</td>

<td>
1 Tun
</td>
</tr>
</table>

</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<p>So, a gallon contains 8 pints and a tun contains 256 gallons. 
</div>

<p>
Of course, we can have positional systems on different bases, like base 12
(AKA "a dozen") and base 7 (AKA a week).  

<P>Below is a form that can help you convert between bytes (8-bit
binary numbers) and decimal numbers easily. Feel free to play with it.

<h2 id="fundamental_relationship">Fundamental Relationship</h2>

<p>One of the key themes of this course is about <em>representations</em>.
Computers represent lots of interesting things, such as colors, pictures,
music, videos, as well as mundane things like numbers and text, or even
complex things like programs.  Ultimately, you know that, at the lowest
level of all those representations, there are <em>bits</em>.

<p>One of the important aspects of these binary representations is the
  relationship between the number of bits and the power of the
  representation.  Just a few decades ago, engineers could have devised a
  representation for, say, videos, but no one would have used it because
  the representation required too many bits, and disk space, and memory
  sizes were so much less than they are now.

<p>Let's be concrete for just a minute.  You saw above that with one bit,
  you can number two things: the one labeled "zero" and the one labeled
  "one," because there are two possible patterns: {0, 1}.  With two bits,
  you can number four things, because there are four possible patterns: {
  00, 01, 10, 11 }.

<p>Here's a table of the relationship between the number of bits and the
  number of patterns:

<p><table class="numbers">
   <tr><th>Number of Bits</th><th>Number of Patterns</th></tr>
   <tr><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr>
   <tr><td>2</td><td>4</td></tr>
   <tr><td>3</td><td>8</td></tr>
   <tr><td>4</td><td>16</td></tr>
   <tr><td>5</td><td>32</td></tr>
   <tr><td>6</td><td>64</td></tr>
   <tr><td>7</td><td>128</td></tr>
   <tr><td>8</td><td>256</td></tr>
   <tr><td colspan="2">...</td></tr>
   <tr><td>16</td><td>&asymp; 65,000</td></tr>
   <tr><td colspan="2">...</td></tr>
   <tr><td>24</td><td>&asymp; 16 million</td></tr>
   <tr><td colspan="2">...</td></tr>
   <tr><td>32</td><td>&asymp; 4 billion</td></tr>
   <tr><td colspan="2">...</td></tr>
   <tr><td>N</td><td>2<sup>N</sup></td></tr>

<p>This fundamental relationship is important and is also unintuitive,
  because it is <em>exponential</em>.  That is, if you double the number
  of bits, you don't get twice as many patterns, you get
  the <em>square</em>.  (Compare 2 bits with 4, or 3 bits with 6.)

<p>We'll see this relationship come up in, for example, our discussion of
  <a href="../M01-color/index.html#indexed_color">indexed color</a>,
  because the limits we place on the number of bits in the representation
  results in a limit on the number of colors.  This is a key idea.

<H2 id="text_rep">Text Representation</H2>

<P>Text is represented with the so-called ASCII code. Years ago, the
manufacturers of early computers decided to represent every possible
character (visible or invisible, like the space or the newline) with a
number. The result was (partially) the code you see below.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="ascii.gif" ALT="The ASCII character set" WIDTH="457" height="266">

<P>To find the code for a particular character in the table, add its row
number on the left (32, 48, etc.) to its column number on top. So, for
example, A is represented by decimal number 65 (i.e., 64 + 1) or binary number
01000001. The greeting "Hi!" is represented by the sequence 72 105 33 or
in binary 010010000110100100100001. Of course some care must be taken to
recognize when we are looking at a number and when we are looking at a
string of characters. But that's not difficult.

<h3>Control Characters</h3>

<p>You'll notice that the table above starts with ASCII code 32, which is
for the space character; yes, even the space character (sometimes denoted
SPC) needs to be represented.  The actual code starts at 0 (which is the
null character, sometimes used to represent the end of a string), but the
first 32 characters are "control" characters, because they were used to
control the early printers.  For example, the TAB character is ASCII code
9.  Since those characters are not interesting in the context of this
class, we've omitted them from the table.

<h3>Line Endings</h3>

<p>If all we had to worry about was characters, text representation would
be pretty straightforward.  However, text is organized into
<em>lines</em>, and for historical reasons, one of the subtle differences
among Windows, Mac and Unix/Linux is how line endings are represented.  In
the olden days before Windows, Macs and Unix, the early <a
href="http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/teletype.html">teletype</a>
printers used two control characters at the end of each line: the carriage
return character to move the print head back to the left, and the linefeed
character to move the paper up by one line.

<p>The Mac represents the end of a line with a carriage return character
(CR, which is ASCII code 13).  Linux uses a line feed character (NL, which
is ASCII code 10).  Windows uses <em>both</em>, just like the olden days.

<p>Usually, when you transfer a text file from system to system, the FTP
program (Fetch, WinSCP, or whatever) substitutes the appropriate line
ending.  The "text mode" of transfer says to make these substitutions;
"binary mode" makes no substitutions and is more suitable for non-text
files, such as images or programs.  Note that HTML and CSS are both kinds
of text.  Most FTP programs have a "guess which mode" setting that usually
works pretty well, but can occasionally make a mistake.

<h3>Unicode</h3>

<P>The early ASCII system had space for 256 symbols, enough to represent
all English characters, punctuation marks, numbers etc. It turns out that
there are other languages on Earth besides English, (;-) and recent
software is being written to accommodate those, too, via a much larger
code called <A
HREF="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/standard/WhatIsUnicode.html">Unicode</A>.
You may want to read up on that in your spare time.

<H2 id="instruction_rep">Instruction Representation</H2>

<P>Once you can represent numbers and characters, you can also represent
<EM>instructions</EM>! It was this observation that led von Neumann and
his collaborators to create a general purpose, reprogrammable
computer. Again, one needs to keep track of when you are looking at
instructions versus a string of characters.

<P>In the future we will learn how the computer represents images, sound
and movies.

<H2 id="bits_bytes">Bits and Bytes</H2>

<p>Groups of bits that are used to represent characters came to be known
  as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte">byte</a>.  Remember
  that a byte is 8 bits.  That Wikipedia page also discusses the history
  of the word and the names for larger groups of bytes, such as

  <ul>
    <li>Kilobytes (kB), or 1000 bytes.  About a quarter of a page of
    text
      
    <li>Megabytes (MB), or 1000 kilobytes.  About 250 small books
    worth of text.

    <li>Gigabytes (GB), which is 1000 MB.  About the amount of text in
    a small library.
  </ul>

<div class="aside">
  <p>A note on the standard abbreviations:
    <ul>
      <li>Uppercase <q>B</q> is used for <em>bytes</em> while
  lowercase <q>b</q> is used for <em>bits</em>.  Network speeds, where
  bits go across a wire one at a time, are usually measured in bits per
  second, or bps.  File sizes are always in bytes, hence kB or MB.
        
      <li>The abbreviation for <q>kilo</q> is a lowercase <q>k</q>,
      hence <q>kB</q> for kilobytes.  The abbreviations for the other
      prefixes (<q>mega</q>, <q>giga</q>, <q>tera</q>, <q>peta</q> ...)
      are all uppercase:  M, G, T, P ....
    </ul>
</div>

<p>Historically, computer scientists have often used <q>kilobyte</q>
  to mean 1024 bytes, because 1024 is pretty close to 1000 and because
  bytes often come in chunks whose size is a power of 2, and
  1024=2<sup>10</sup>.  For example, if you buy a 4 GB flash drive, it
  won't hold exactly 4 billion bytes, but a bit more because of this
  difference.  Hard drives and network speeds, on the other hand, are
  usually measured in powers of 10 rather than powers of two.  In
  practice, it rarely matters.

<P>Computers these days come with huge amounts of storage space on the
  hard drive (often hundreds of GB), but they are usually able to
  process only a few GB of them at a time (their <em>main memory</em>
  or RAM).  We will use these symbols often in future lectures.
