          <h2 id="selectors">CSS Selectors</h2>
          <p>When we talked about <a href="../L03/CSS.html">CSS rules</a>, we described 
            the generic form of a rule as in
          Figure 1. At the head of the rule is the selector, followed by a series of 
          property and values pairs enclosed in curly braces.</p>
                  
          <figure class="text-center">
            <img src="images/css_rule.png" alt="depiction of a css rule"
                 class="img-thumbnail">
            <figcaption>Figure 1: Depiction of a CSS Rule</figcaption>
          </figure>
          
          <p>Today's focus is on the <code>selector</code>. The selector indicates
            which element(s) the rule will apply to. So far, we have seen a few kinds
            of selectors and these notes will add some more to this list.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><em>element</em> , e.g., <code>p</code>, <code>em</code>, <code>li</code>, etc. Such
              a selector will apply to <strong>all</strong> elements of this kind in the document.</li>
              <li><em>element.classname</em>, e.g, <code>span.booktitle</code>. Such a selector will apply
                to the indicated elements with the attribute <code>class=classname</code>.</li>
              <li><em>.classname</em>, e.g., <code>.tiltright</code>, <code>.tiltleft</code>. 
              Such a selector will apply to different kinds of elements that share the attribute 
                <code>class=classname</code>.</li>
              <li><em>#idName</em>, e.g., <code>#main</code>, etc. Such a selector applies to a 
              <strong>single</strong> element that has the attribute <code>id=idName</code>.</li>  
              <li><em>element, element, ...</em>, e.g., <code>h1, h2, h3</code>, etc. Such a selector
              is used in those cases we want elements of different kinds to share a set of rules. This way,
              we avoid retyping the same rules. It is also allowed to add individual rules for such 
              elements separately as well.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>One could certainly stop here and don't worry about more kinds of selectors, because by adding
          class or id attributes to our elements, we could always use one of the above described selectors. 
          The problem with the approach of using <em>styling hooks</em> is that it makes the code difficult to read
          and maintain, since we will be adding lots of class
          and id attributes only for the purpose of styling (hence the name: styling hooks).</p>
          
          <p>To illustrate, here is an example (from the "Book of CSS3"):</p>
          <pre>
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li class="first odd"&gt;&lt;span&gt;F&lt;/span&gt;irst list item&lt;/li&gt; 
    &lt;li&gt;Second item&lt;/li&gt; 
    &lt;li class="odd">Third item&lt;/li&gt; 
    &lt;li class="last">Last item&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>
          <p>Notice that it's possible to have <strong>multiple class names</strong> in a single
          class attribute (first and odd). However, imagine a situation in which you add more items to this list,
          you'll have to reorder the class attributes, because the sequence of odd and even items
          might change, etc.</p>
          
          <p>There are two ways to deal with this situation, which we describe in the following 
          sections: <em>descendant selectors</em> and <em>pseudo-selectors</em>.</p>
          
          <h2 id="desc">Descendant Selectors</h2>
          <p>As we will keep repeating throughout this semester, an HTML document can be
          modeled as a tree. At the root is the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element, with 
          all other elements as descendants, grouped in different families. <a href="../chrome-inspect/inspect.html">
          Chrome's Inspect Element</a> gives a very good depiction of such a tree (we will
            call this depiction a DOM (Document Object Model), and will study it in more detail in the future).
          </p>
          
          <p>Here is a graphic of the DOM tree from the example you worked in 
            <a href="../../labs/lab02/part2/">Lab</a>.</p>
          
          <figure class="text-center">
            <img src="images/tree.png" alt="depiction of the DOM tree"
                 class="img-thumbnail">
            <figcaption>Figure 2: Depiction of a DOM Tree</figcaption>
          </figure>
          
          <p>Since DOM is a tree, we will use the same analogy with the family tree that we used
          when talking about folders and files in creating relative URLs. Nodes (that is elements),
          can be ancestors or descendants, parents or children, as well as siblings.</p>
          
          <p>As you already know, if you apply a rule to an element (for example, removing the underline 
          for <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element, every link in the document will be styled without an underline.
          But this is not what you may intend. You might want that only links in the navbar don't have
          an underline, while all the others should.</p>
          
          <p>The solution in this case is a <em>descendant selector</em>. Such a selector specifies 
          the path inside the DOM tree for the element who want the rule to apply exclusively. </p>
          
          <p>Figure 3 shows the path of elements in which our <code>a</code> element is nested,
            as displayed by Chrome's Inspect Element window. This
          is an absolute path, starting from the root, <code>html</code>. When we specify the selector,
          we can use only parts of such a path, such as <code>nav ul li a</code>, or simply <code>nav a</code>.</p>
          
          <figure class="text-center">
            <img src="images/nesting.png" alt="depiction of the DOM tree to show nesting elements"
                 class="img-thumbnail">
            <figcaption>Figure 3: Nested elements path as depicted in Inspect Element window.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          
          <p>Keep in mind that in order to use the descendant selectors, you need to use more structure
          in your HTML document. If all your links are directly in the <code>body</code> or unamed divs,
          there is no unique path to different elements, since they are all siblings.</p>
          
          <p>In addition to the example we saw, there are other selectors that use the DOM 
          relationships. For example, <code>span>a</code>, which selects all <code>a</code>
          elements that have as a <strong>parent</strong> a <code>span</code>, or 
          <code>div+h3</code> will select <code>h3</code> elements that immediately
          follow a <code>div</code> (an adjacent sibling), and many more.</p>
          
          <p>To better understand the different kinds of CSS selectors, refer to the code examples in 
            <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp">W3Schools CSS Selectors</a>'
          page.</p>
          
          
          <h2 id="pseudo">Pseudo-selectors: <small>pseudo-class</small> and <small>pseudo-element</small></h2>
          <p>The selectors we have seen so far can be grouped under the label of DOM selectors,
          because they operate with information that is explicit in the DOM tree (element names or
          their attributes). However, in many cases, we would like to style aspects of the elements
          that cannot be found directly in the tree, for example, how a link should look like when 
          we hover over it. To do this, we will use <em>pseudo-selectors</em>. Such selectors
          act on elements or information that sits outside of the document tree 
            (such as the state of a link, the first letter of a paragraph or the last child of 
            a parent element).</p>
          
          <p>Pseudo-selectors come in two flavors: pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>A pseudo-class</strong> differentiates among an element’s different 
              states or types. Examples of using <em>states</em> of an element are: 
              information about link states: <code>:hover</code>, <code>:visited</code>, 
              <code>:active</code>, about form inputs states: <code>:checked</code>, 
            <code>:disabled</code>. Examples of using the <em>type</em> of an element are structural
            pseudo-classes such as 
              <code>:first-child</code> [see <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_sel_firstchild">example</a>], 
              <code>:nth-child(odd)</code>
              [see <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss3_nth-child_odd_even">example</a>], 
              <code>:nth-of-type(n)</code> [see <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss3_nth-of-type">example</a>]. Finally, in CSS3, there is a new pseudo-class known as <code>:not</code>,
              which negates a rule for the selected element (that is, the rule will apply to
              all other elements that are not selected). See <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss3_not">example</a>.
            </li>
            <li><strong>A pseudo-element</strong> provides access to an element’s subpart, 
            which includes those pseudo-elements that select portions of text nodes, 
            for instance, <code>:first-line</code> 
              [see <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_firstline">example</a>]
              or <code>:first-letter</code> [see <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_sel_firstletter">example</a>].</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>In CSS3, to differentitate between pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements, the syntax 
          to refer to them has changed. An element is referred with a double colon. You will see
          both examples on the Web, because they are still supported by browsers. Two new 
          pseudo-elements that are also interesting are <code>::before</code> and 
          <code>::after</code> which can be used to add content before or after an element. These 
          are used when one wants to add icons in front or after certain elements, see 
            <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_before">example</a>.</p>
