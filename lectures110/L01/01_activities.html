            <p>We like to begin this course with a little HTML
            exercise, <em>even though</em> you don't know any HTML yet.

            <p>Note that all our directions will be for Google Chrome;
            that's the standard browser for this course.
              
            <p>Use View/Developer/View Source in Chrome (the keyboard
              shortcut is command-option-u on  a Mac)
              to look at the
              <em>source</em> for this web page
              about <a href="csfun/CSfun.html">fun CS department activities</a>.
              
              <p>Use your intuition to answer the following questions
                about other HTML code in this file.  Guesswork is
                encouraged.  You'll learn better if you write out the
                answers and compare them with your neighbor's
                answers. Discuss any discrepancies or ambiguity.

                <ol>
   
                  <li>How is a <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> different
                    from <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>?  (each web page should have a
                    distinct title!)
   
                  <li>How is <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> different from <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>? from
                    <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>?

                  <li>How is a bullet list created?
   
                  <li>What does <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> do?

                  <li>What does <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> do?

                  <li>What does <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> do?
                    
                  <li>What does <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> do?

                  <li>What does <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> do?

                  <li>What does <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> do?
   
                  <li>How are the beginning and end of a region (part of
                  the document) marked?
   
                  <li>Are there any tags that don't have both a beginning
                    and an end?
   
                  <li>What tag is used to insert an image? How does its
                    use differ from other tags in the file?

                  <li>How are hyperlinks (links to other web pages) created?

                </ol>

              <p>Ask questions about anything you don't understand.
