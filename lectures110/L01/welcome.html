          <h1 id="welcome">Welcome to CS110</h1>
          <p>We think this is a wonderfully exciting course that will introduce
          you to some of the cool things that computers can do and
          put some of that power in <em>your</em> hands!

   <h2 id="bigideas">Big Ideas</h2>

<ul>
   <li><strong>Digital Representation of Information</strong>:
      numbers, text, images, video, sound, web pages, programs,
      encryption, compression. 

   <li><strong>Impact of the Digital Revolution</strong>:
      information access, publishing, organizing, security, privacy, copyright. 

   <li><strong>Problem Solving</strong>:
      divide/conquer/glue, abstraction, modularity/reusability,
      programming, debugging.

   <li><strong>Project Development Lifecycle</strong>:
      requirements, design, implementation, testing.
</ul>

 <h2 id="overview">Course Overview</h2>

<ul>
   <li>HTML = HyperText Markup Language: specify the <em>structure/content</em> of a web page. 
   <li>CSS = Cascading Style Sheets: specify the <em>appearance</em> of a web page. 
   <li>JavaScript (not Java): specify the <em>behavior</em> of a web page. 
   <li>Concepts and tools for graphics, sound, forms, animation, and movies.
   <li>Social, legal, ethical implications of the digital revolution
       (<em><a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/">Blown to Bits</a></em> topics).
   <li>Designing a website and implementing it using HTML, CSS, and 
       JavaScript.
</ul>

<h3>Why Programming?</h3>

<ul>
   <li>Computer Science is about <em>computation</em> as a tool for
   understanding the world: building models, experimenting, and
   finding implications
   
   <li>Programming is a formal notation for specifying
   <em>algorithms</em> = computational recipes = procedures for doing things
   
<!--
   <li>Programming constructs are the trees, computation is the
   forest
-->
</ul>

<h3>Term Project</h3>

<ul>
   <li><strong>Form</strong> teams of two students and an advisor.
   
   <li><strong>Find</strong> a client in need of a website,
     or <strong>choose</strong> a project of your own.
   
   <li><strong>Specify</strong> client's requirements.
   
   <li><strong>Design, implement,</strong> and <strong>test</strong> 
       web pages.
   
   <li><strong>Deliver</strong> final product.
   
   <li><strong>Present</strong> your website in class.
</UL>

examples.

<h2 id="administration">Course Administration</h2>

<p>The <a href="../../courseinfo/">course administration</a> and
<a href="../../syllabus/">course schedule</a> pages provide important
information about course organization and policies, and links to materials for lectures,
labs and assignments.

<h2 id="todo">To Do</h2>

<p>The <a href="todo.html">CS110 To-Do List</a> lists some things to do
during the first weeks of the semester.  There are a few items to do
today, which we'll talk about.</p>

<h2 id="works">How this Course Works</h2>

<p>Technical material is not fully absorbed in just one reading; you will
  probably have to read things several times. Full command of the material
  requires <em>practice</em>.

  <ul>
    <li>Please <em>read</em> the online material before class (but not the
      <q>class activities</q>). We will keep the online readings short, but
      you should allocate an hour or more for it, because they can be dense.
      
    <li>The book readings are <em>optional but encouraged</em>. Sometimes
    a second and distinctly different presentation of the material will
    really help things click.

    <li>Ask questions in class. We will usually review some of the
      material in class, but we won't say everything that is in the
      reading. If there's something that confused you, please ask!
      
    <li>We will do clicker questions and in-class exercises
      (the <q>flipped</q> classroom). There is a lot of pedagogical
      research to show that that is the most effective way to learn, but
      it won't work if you haven't read the material.
  </ul>

<h2>Supplemental Instruction</h2>

<p>Maggie Jennings is our <em>Supplemental Instructor</em>. I'll give her
  a few minutes to talk about that.

<h2 id="new">What's New?</h2>

<p>We've made some changes to CS 110 this year:
  <ul>
    <li>Clients for the project are <em>optional</em>; you can be your own
    client. Partners are still required.
      
    <li>A list of pre-approved JavaScript applications, which we'll learn
    in class and practice in lab and on assignments.

    <!--<li>The requirements document (P1) is dropped; this affords us more
    time to practice HTML and JavaScript.-->
      
    <li>More homework assignments to practice concepts (but each is less intense).

    <li>Reduced content for greater comprehension.

  </ul>
