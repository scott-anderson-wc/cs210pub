           <h2>Photo Gallery: Step-by-step</h2> 
			
			<p>You can follow along with this example on your own.
			Start by downloading the folder <code>pg</code> from the
			<code>cs110dl</code> account. The password for the account is 
				given in the Google Groups. The folder you'll download contains 
				all pictures used for the photo gallery.</p>
			
			<p>The steps below are also described in the <a href="L01-photogallery.pdf">lecture slides</a>.</p>
			
			<p>Here is the list of the steps we follow to build the (very simple) photo
			gallery:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Create a simple HTML page and add the <code>img</code>
			element to include the first photo from the "panoramas" folder. The result
				should be the same as in <a href="pg/pg1.html">this page</a>.</li>
				<li>Use the attribute <code>width</code> to resize the image.
				This is the <a href="pg/pg2.html">result.</a></li>
				<li>Now we can add a second image. This is the <a href="pg/pg3.html">result.</a></li>
				<li>Adding all images will show the <a href="pg/pg.html">photo gallery</a></li>			
			</ol>
			<p>As we discussed in class, even with the fast Internet connection from Wellesley
			College, it still takes a few seconds for all images to show in the page. This is
			why we always are going to resize pictures taken with digital camera, to go from
			some MB of size to only a few KB of size.</p>
			
			<p>Finally, we showed in class how we can make the page responsive and look different,
			if we use CSS. Here is the <a href="pg/pg_r.html">responsive page</a>. 
			Try to resize your browser to see how the page is changing.</p>
