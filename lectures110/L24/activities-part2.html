<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>By the end of today, you should:
  <ol>
    <li>understand digital signatures and message digests
  </ol>

  <h2>Proving Identity</h2>

  <p>We all know that identity theft is a big modern problem. How can you
  prove you are who you are? How does the thief prove they are you?
  Usually it's by having certain <q>magic</q> numbers that only you are
  supposed to have, like your Social Security Number (SSN) and
  such. Unfortunately, in day to day life, we don't usually have anything
  much better than that. Computer scientists have invented something
  better, namely <em>digital signatures.</em>

  <h2>Digital Signatures</h2>

  <p>First, digital signatures have <em>nothing</em> to do with privacy
  and security.  Just the opposite. You may want to prove to
  the <em>world</em> that you signed something.  Don't confuse these.
    <ul>
      <li>Alice wants to sign a public message.  She already has a public
      key pair (S,P) and everyone has P.
        
      <li>She composes the message to be signed, M.
        
      <li>She posts M and E<sub>S</sub>(M).  That is, she posts the
      message <em>and</em> its encryption using her <em>secret</em> key.
        
      <li>Anyone can compute D<sub>P</sub>(E<sub>S</sub>(M)) and check
      that it matches M.
        
      <li>Since <em>only</em> Alice could have created such an encrypted
      form of that message, it <em>must</em> have been from Alice.
    </ul>

    <p>The same idea can be used for Alice to prove her identity!  All she
    has to do is sign a message and anyone can verify that the message was
    signed by her.

<h2>Message Digests</h2>

    <p>Because digital signatures take significant computing time, in
    practice Alice doesn't sign M, but rather a <em>message digest</em>. A
    message digest algorithm puts M through a kind of deterministic
    cuisinart that reduces it to just a small number of bits, say 128 or
    256. However, the digest is (essentially) <em>unique</em>, like
    fingerprints.

    <p>Just as your fingerprint is much smaller than you, but just as
    unique as you are, message digests are smaller but uniquely identify a
    message.

    <p>They have some really cool properties:
      <ul>
        <li>They're relatively <em>quick</em> to compute.
          
        <li>They're essentially <em>unique</em> to a message. (There's only a 1 in
          2<sup>128</sup> chance that two different messages would have the
          same digest.)
          
        <li>They depend on the entire message. Change just a single
          character, and the digest changes. So it's like a <em>fingerprint</em>.
          
        <li>You can't run them backwards to get the message back. They are
          <em>one-way</em> functions.
      </ul>
      <p>This makes message digests useful for a host of cryptographic
      techniques. We'll just explore them a little.

<h2>Demo of MD5</h2>

<p>Something built in to all your Macs is <em>md5</em>. I'll demo using that.

<h2>Quiz Question Nr. 1</h2>
  <p>When Bob signs a message he's sending to Alice, he uses:
  <ol type="A">
    <li><p>Bob's secret key
    <li><p>Bob's public key
    <li><p>Alice's secret key
    <li><p>Alice's public key
  </ol> 


<h2>Quiz Question Nr. 2</h2>
  <p>Which of the following is FALSE about message digests:
  <ol type="A">
    <li><p>it is infeasible to find two different messages with the same digest
    <li><p>it is infeasible to modify a message without changing the digest
    <li><p>it is infeasible to recreate a message knowing its digest
    <li><p>it is infeasible to compute the digest for any given message
  </ol>

  <h2 id="signature_exercise">Exercise Using Digital Signatures</h2>

  <p>Let's make this a bit more realistic.  Use the same partner as you
  used before in the RSA exercise, so your partner already knows your
  public key.  One of you will be the <em>sender</em> and the other
  the <em>receiver</em>.  The receiver is the one who knows the sender's
  public key.  If both of you know the other's public key, either can be
  the receiver.

  <p>I'll do this on the instructor station while you follow along.
  <ol>

    <li>The sender creates a message of some sort.
      
    <li>She uses the <a target="_blank"
        href="http://caligatio.github.io/jsSHA/"> SHA-2</a> page to create
        a digest of the message.

    <li>She <a  target="_blank" href="rsa-secret.html">generates a digital signature of the
    digest using her secret, private key</a>

    <li>She sends all three of these to the receiver.  In our demo,
    though, we'll just send the MD and the signed MD.

    <li>The receiver <a  target="_blank" href="rsa-public.html">checks the digital
    signature of the digest using the sender's public key</a> by copying
    those two values in to the bottom two fields and clicking the check
    signature button.

  </ol>
</div>

<h2>Certificates in Real Life</h2>

<p>The public key that your browser downloads is <em>signed</em> by
    a <em>certificate authority</em>.

<p>This gives you some assurance:
    <ul>
        <li>that the website is who it says it is,
    like checking someone's ID card.
            
        <li>It doesn't say they are honest and
    trustworthy
            
        <li>only that they aren't someone else.

        <li>It's a little like
        a <a href="https://www.nationalnotary.org/knowledge-center/about-notaries"><em>notary
                    public</em></a>, who checks someone's ID when they sign a document.

    </ul>

<p>Let's look at this page via https!


<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>We'll break up into groups and discuss:

<ul>
    <li>Who should prevail: Apple or the government?
        
    <li>What's the dividing line between individual privacy and collective
    security?
        
    <li>What about <em>ransomware</em>? How can encryption be used against
    innocent people?

    <li>Practical issues for use of strong encryption?
        
</ul>


<h2 id="sec_summary">Summary</h2>
<p>We hope that after these activities you can:
  <ul>
    <li>understand how encryption and decryption work
    <li>undertand the difference between private and publick key cryptography
    <li>the uses of private and public key cryptography
  </ul>
