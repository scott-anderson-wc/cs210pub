<h2>A Magic Trick</h2>

<p>There's nothing up by sleeves, nothing in my head ...

<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>By the end of today, you should:
  <ol>
    <li><p>understand differences between analog and digital signals
    <li><p>understand sampling rate, bit resolution, bit rate and calculating file size
    <li><p>think about the basics of Copyright law
  </ol>

 <h2>Analog and Digital</h2>

<p>Our ears interact with an analog world of sound waves, but music and
  other sounds are all being done digitally now.  Why?  How?
  <ul>
    <li>Analog signals always <em>degrade</em> with time, distance and
    other factors.

    <li>With an analog signal, you can't be entirely sure of what the
    original sound was supposed to be out of the literally infinite number
    of possibilities.

    <li>Digital signals are only transmitting one of <em>two</em> possible
    values (zero and one). Each is a <em>bit</em>.

    <li>Therefore, when the receiver gets a degraded signal, it can make
    an informed guess about which of the two possibilities was actually
    transmitted.  This allows the signal to be <em>cleaned-up</em>.

</ul>

<h2>Quiz Question Nr. 1</h2>

  <p>Sound travels faster in:
  <ol type="A">
    <li><p>vacuum
    <li><p>water
    <li><p>air
    <li><p>speed doesn't depend on the medium
  </ol>

  <h2>Quiz Question Nr. 2</h2>
  <p>A little yappy dog's barking is:
  <ol type="A">
    <li><p>Low amplitude, low pitch
    <li><p>Low amplitude, high pitch
    <li><p>High amplitude, low pitch
    <li><p>High amplitude, high pitch
  </ol>

  <h2>Quiz Question Nr. 3</h2>

  <p>Analog signals are superior to digital signals.
  <ol type="A">
    <li><p>True</p>
    <li><p>False</p>
    <li><p>There is no difference between the two.</p>
  </ol>

  <h2>Parity bits</h2>

  Furthermore, by adding <em>redundant</em> information in the form
  of <em>parity</em> bits, errors can be <em>detected</em>.

  By using additional parity bits, the receiver can figure
  out <em>which</em> bit is erroneous and, since there are only two
  possible values, errors can be <em>corrected</em>.

  Thus, it is possible, using digital representations, to
    have <em>perfect</em> transmission.


  <h2>Quiz Question Nr. 3b</h2>

  <p>Digital signals are superior to analog because
  <ol type="A">
    <li><p>Errors can be avoided
    <li><p>Errors can be detected
    <li><p>Errors can be corrected
    <li><p>Signals can be compressed
  </ol>

  <h2>Quiz Question Nr. 4</h2>

  <p>When will the parity bit <strong>NOT</strong> be able to detect an error:
  <ol type="A">
    <li><p>When there is an odd number of bits in the transmission.</p>
    <li><p>When there is an even number of bits in the transmission.</p>
    <li><p>When the number of changed bits is even.</p>
    <li><p>When the number of changed bits is odd.</p>
  </ol>

 <h2>Quiz Question Nr. 5</h2>
  <p>Assume that the even parity bit indicates that there has been an error in transmission, what is
our best option?
  <ol type="A">
    <li><p>There is nothing we can do about it, noise is part of every transmission.
    <li><p>We can use the parity bit to identify the error and fix it.
    <li><p>We can use error correction algorithms to reconstruct the original signal.
    <li><p>We will have to request for the signal to be retransmitted.
  </ol>

<h2>Limitations in Hearing</h2>

    tone generator</a> or this <a href="hearing-test/">hearing test</a>.

<h2>Digital Sound Representation</h2>

<p>Have I convinced you?  Good. So, how do we do it?  How do we represent
  sound digitally?
  <ul>

    <li>Imagine drawing the analog signal on graph paper.  Make two
    crucial decisions:
      <ul>
        <li>The <em>resolution</em> on the vertical axis, and

        <li>the <em>resolution</em> on the horizonal axis.
      </ul>

    <li><em>Sample</em> the analog signal at each vertical line (each
      moment in time), rounding it off at the nearest horizontal line.
      Write this down as a number.

    <li>The sequence of numbers is then the <em>digitized</em> signal.

    <li>The resolution of the vertical axis (how close together the
        horizontal lines are) determines the <em>number of bits per
        sample</em>.  Usually, this is some nice round number like 8, 16
        or 32 bits per sample.

    <li>The resolution of the horizontal axis (how close together the
      vertical lines are) determines the <em>sampling rate</em>.

    <li>The product of these two gives the <em>bit-rate</em>.

    <li>The greater the bit rate, the better the receiver
      can <em>reconstruct</em> the original signal.

    <li>The Nyquist theorem tells us how high the sampling rate has to be
    in order to capture sounds up to a given maximum frequency (pitch).

  </ul>






  <h2>Quiz Question Nr. 6</h2>
  <p>The bit resolution is:
  <ol type="A">
    <li><p>The sampling rate.
    <li><p>A multiple of the fundamental frequency.
    <li><p>The number of bits to represent frequency values.
    <li><p>The number of bits to represent amplitude values.
  </ol>

  <h2>Quiz Question Nr. 7</h2>
  <p>If the whales can produce sound in the range 10 Hz - 30 KHz, at what frequency we would have
to sample to produce a digital recording?
  <ol type="A">
    <li><p>15 KHz <!-- (half of the high pitch) -->
    <li><p>20 KHz <!-- (twice the low pitch) -->
    <li><p>30 KHz <!-- (the high pitch) -->
    <li><p>45 Khz <!-- (the sum of the low and high pitch) -->
    <li><p>60 KHz <!--  (twice the high pitch) -->
  </ol>

<h2>Task 1: File Size by Hand</h2>

<P>Compute the bit rate in bits per second and the approximate file size
in KB given the following information:
<ul>
    <li>Pitches up to 50KHz
    <li>16 bit resolution
    <li>10 seconds of sound
</ul>

<p>You might get the following:

<div class="hidden_from_student">
<p>Sampling rate is 100 KHz (double)
<p>Bit rate is 100,000 * 16 bits or 1,600,000 bits per second
<p>File size is 10 * 1,600,000 / (8 * 1000) = 10 * 200 = 2000 KB

</div>



<h2>Task 2: File Size by JS</h2>

  <p>Knowing that the <strong>bit rate</strong> is the number of bits to represent one second of digital sound,
      write jQuery/Javascript code that will perform the calculations for the form shown below.</p>
  <p>The statements for reading the content from the fields is already given, you need to write two
      functions that take paremeters and return values and invoke them. Read comments in the execution
      box.</p>

   <div class="row">
   <div class="col-md-8">

     <pre>&lt;form&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bit Resolution: &lt;input name="resolution"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sampling Rate: &lt;input name="sampling"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time (in seconds): &lt;input name="seconds"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bit Rate is: &lt;span id="bitrate"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The File Size is: &lt;span id="filesize"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</pre>

     </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <form style="background-color:lavender">
<p>Bit Resolution (in bits): <input name="resolution" size=5></p>
<p>Sampling Rate (in Hz): <input name="sampling" size=5></p>
<p>Time (in seconds): <input name="seconds" size=5></p>
<p>The Bit Rate is: <span id="bitrate"></span> bits/second.</p>
<p>The File Size is: <span id="filesize"></span> KB.</p>
</form>
     </div>
  </div>
<div id="exbox">
<p> <textarea id="code" rows=22 cols=100>
// Gather data from input fields
var bitRes = parseInt($("[name='resolution']").val());
var sampling = parseInt($("[name='sampling']").val());
var seconds = parseInt($("[name='seconds']").val());

/* Define a function named calculate_bitrate with two parameters, like the
   first two in the form, and one return value, the bit rate in bits per
   second.*/



$("#bitrate").text(); // invoke your function

/* Define a function named calculate_filesize with three parameters, like
   the three in the form, and one return value, the file size in
   kilobytes. */



$("#filesize").text() // invoke your function
  </textarea>
  </p>
  <button id="exec" onclick="eval($('#code').val())">Execute Code</button>
</div>

<p>Your solution might look like this:
    
<div class="hidden_from_student">
<pre class="prettyprint lang">
function calculate_bitrate(bRes, sRate){
  return bRes * sRate;
}
$("#bitrate").text(calculate_bitrate(bitRes, sampling));

function calculate_filesize(bRes, sRate, seconds){
  var bitrate = calculate_bitrate(bRes, sRate);
  return bitrate * seconds / (8*1000); // convert in KB
}
$("#filesize").text(calculate_filesize(bitRes, sampling, seconds));

</pre>
</div>
